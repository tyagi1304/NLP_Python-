I love long-form movies, I'm deeply interested in science, and I love film.This is a personal review, I'm not trying to be unbiased - just raw and authentic with my feelings towards the movie. Enjoy or hate as you will:Here are my reasons why I think Oppenheimer is a bad movie:Insane amounts of dry exposition:Some of it was creatively weaved in, but the majority felt very pace-breaking and unnatural. This is a common trope in Nolan movies, but this is by far the worst hyperbolic version of it. It completely breaks the characters, pacing, and immersion of the reality he is trying to establish. It felt quite lazy and uncreative a lot of the time.Terrible pacing:Besides the main hooks in the movie, Ludwig and the editing team made some amazing sequences, but for the most part, it's largely quite boring. However, the hooks of the movie keep you grounded in your seat long enough not to fall asleep when trying to trench through the shallow characters and exposition avalanche, until you come to another hook in the movie which tie you back down in your seat for another avalanche of uncreative exposition.A lot of the dramatization of the characters and perspective felt very pretentious at times:Yes, it is profound to harness the strong force, and make a film about it - but there is a subtle self-importance to the film. It's the feeling of an artist knowing they create profound art, and the self awareness seeps into the art and you can feel it. It's hard to explain, but I feel it's tangible in this film. I do enjoy that it teaches newer generations about history and the dangers of humanity with such technology - but it felt self indulgent at times and it's hard to explain; for that I apologize -- I wish I was better with my words. I'm sure someone out there feels what I feel.CGI dust on the screen completely ruining the continuity of the film and image:This is obviously something only some people will notice, but it's just absolutely wild that post production thought it was a good idea to have floating particles cover up the beautiful scape of Los Alamos. Cheap, uncreative, and unnecessary CGI atmosphere. Usually these visual effects can blend quite well in majority CGI films, but something so grounded with such high dynamic range, shot on film with this ridiculous atmospheric effect added just breaks the aesthetic of film entirely.Florence Pugh's character was very shallow and was used uncreatively as an narrative tool:Yes, we're used to this with many Nolan films, shallow characters used to drive the main characters motivations in an obvious way. You can use your characters more creatively and mask the plot tools that they truly are; have them feel more authentic as characters and not just shallow story telling tools.Jack Quaid's cameo was an awkward choice of casting:He says a few lines and plays bongos in the background of a few scenes and whenever I saw him on screen, it felt so wrong. Maybe there was potential to have him fit in another way, but there's something about his acting and presence that is super unconvincing and unfitting. This is likely just a bias that I cannot explain due to association of him in outside media - but there's something tangibly wrong with him being in this film lmao.EDIT: extra points from other peopleDon’t forget the part where they “Woke It Up” by inserting black scientists on the Manhattan project and black female students in his 1930’s quantum physics classes.disrespecting Einstein and John von Neumann’s involvementThey dropped 2 nukes on Japan, inconceivable amounts of Japanese died. considering it’s a perspective on the trauma only Oppenheimer felt and Not to mention the way they disrespect Einstein & leave out any involvement from John von Neumann on the Manhattan project? The over dramatisation, implying Oppenheimer is the most important man in the world and the only one that could have discovered how to harness the strong force? The last act of the movie being all about Oppenheimer’s security clearance and how we should feel for him morally, for the egotistical scientist that quotes “now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds…”?The entire perspective of the movie is pretentious.Some innovations that were great in the movie:The way Nolan portrays psychological distress:Nolan did a great job portraying psychological distress. He used creative editing and physical shaking of the environment abd avoids those typical cheesy visual effects representing trauma in your average movie or Tv drama. It was very creative and arguably innovative.The hooks in the movie had incredible pacing in synchronicity to Ludwig's score AND ironically great exposition:In one example: Nolan literally tells the audience when the climax is coming and subverts your expectations of the climax with creative cinematography, editing and sound. (if you've seen the movie, you'll likely understand what I'm talking about)The acting:The acting was excellent. Cillian Murphy was particularly good as J. Robert Oppenheimer. And of course the rest of the cast excluding Jack Quaid chameo.Overall, I think Oppenheimer is effective in the hooks and even innovative with it's stylistic mechanics in film making, but a terrible movie inbetween. The movie is boring for the most part, and the exposition is lazy and uncreative.THE MAIN SUMMARY OF WHY ITS BAD:Lazy plot devicing of characters, exposition overload and bad pacing.Read moreShareRelated Answers SectionRelated AnswersReview of Oppenheimer as a bad movieAnalysis of Oppenheimer's character portrayalOppenheimer movie genre and themesOppenheimer film age rating and contentMost underrated films of the last decadeNew to Reddit?Create your account and connect with a world of communities.Continue with EmailContinue With Phone NumberBy continuing, you agree to ourUser Agreementand acknowledge that you understand thePrivacy Policy.Upcoming MoviesPublicAnyone can view, post, and comment to this communityTop PostsRedditreReddit: Top posts of July 21, 2023RedditreReddit: Top posts of July 2023RedditreReddit: Top posts of 2023Reddit RulesPrivacy PolicyUser AgreementAccessibilityReddit, Inc. © 2025.

Robert Oppenheimer, known as the 'Father of Atomic Bomb’. The film chronicles the events that precede and succeed the world’s first nuclear test led by Oppenheimer for the US Army, code named ‘Trinity’.Review:Love and regret lie at the heart of Christopher Nolan’s movies no matter how complex and demanding they seem in structure and storytelling. True to his style in spirit but deviating from the usual in execution and content, the acclaimed director creates a moving masterpiece on human disillusionment. How a man’s biggest discovery and bravery marked his biggest doom. Oppenheimer may have been a genius, but he wasn’t acquainted with the ways of the world.He spoke his mind, trusted everyone, and paid a price for it.Talky and dense, the film unravels like a psychological horror-investigative-courtroom thriller even as it recreates known historical events. IMAX cameras go dangerously close to the actors exposing every pore, every unsaid emotion, and every falling tear perfectly. Sound and silence especially in that chilling detonation scene, play an unsettling game of hide and seek.Ludwig Göransson’s music lends the film its unnerving ticking time bomb effect.Nolan keeps amplifying your anxiety, holding you emotionally captive with no interest to slow down whatsoever. You find yourself being moved to tears as he finally releases his flawed lead character from the prison of his own guilt.The 3-hour long film is based on Pulitzer Prize-winning biography called ‘American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer’. It meticulously follows the celebrated and controversial physicist's life story in a nonlinear fashion. The narrative shuttles between past and present while addressing the key events leading up to the nuclear test and its repercussions. These involve the American Jew’s equation with self, fellow scientists includingAlbert Einstein, political activism leaning left, implications on him being a Russian spy and revocation of his security clearance in an unfair government hearing.A man who took great pride in his discoveries could never look at it in the eye. The atomic bomb though only forms a section of the film, it largely studies the mindset of its creator. Oppenheimer’s ambition and relentless love for physics swamp him with a sense of impending doom and moral scruples. Nolan cleverly pits Oppenheimer’s heart against his mind and the disconnect between the two at the centre of his film.If you happen to be aWorld War IIgeek, you will get the Germany-USA-Japan-Russia arms race and socio-political situation better.One man’s desire to combat fascism and save lives resulted in the destruction of human lives and no one could have played it better thanCillian Murphy. His soul-piercing blue eyes convey agony and quiet anger remarkably. Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt are excellent.Matt Damon, Rami Malek and Kenneth Branagh are well cast in extended cameos.Oppenheimer leaves you in tatters as it is a gripping piece on a man consumed by guilt and inner turmoil. “A man who became death, the destroyer of worlds.” You won't forget this film for a long time.User Reviews0/1500Post ReviewPhotos0Latest Movie ReviewsPrevious0SaiyaaraDrama & Romance2h 36m3.0Critic's Rating3.0Users' RatingSaiyaara is a visually lush, emotive, and melody-driven experience that’s effective as a romantic musical.0Nikita RoyHorror, Mystery & Thriller1h 54m3.0Critic's Rating3.0Users' RatingThe film aims to pit superstition against science and faith against blind faith.

      "Based on Kai Bird’s & Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer-winning biography “American Prometheus”.MembersOnline•Extreme_Speaker3671A Life Changing Film. My Review of Oppenheimer (2023)Movie DiscussionIn my opinion, it's Nolan's greatest film thus far, and my personal favorite movie in general.It's a very impactful visceral experience that makes you feel strong emotions of awe, concern and wonder. You think and feel about humanity throughout the film and it's difficult to stop thinking about these feelings after you leave the theater. The actors and story remind you what it means to be human, with people's everyday emotions and feelings like calm, hope, love, glamour, lust, sadness, empathy, jealousy, chaos and hatred. Yet you also feel the immense fragility of humanity due to our potential for barbarism, conspiracy and self-destruction at the level of the atomic bomb, while also feeling awe for our ingenuity, intelligence and glamour in our scientific, political and artistic pursuits in life. These contradictory feelings of the nature of human life are interwoven with each other and it makes you ponder how complex, beautiful, serious, grandiose, important and precious our lives are. The film is made all the more potent once you realize all of this, developing and using atomic bomb, and for the most part, happened, and this is who we are, and you are viewing, to some extent, reality, when you watch the bomb explode and observe the human circumstances arround it. Cillian Murphy does a great job as Dr. Oppenheimer, as do the others. I highly recommend seeing it in Imax to get a bigger screen and a louder Soundsystem to fully enjoy what I believe is a once in a lifetime achievement in cinematography, acting, soundtrack and sound editing.In a bad or mediocre movie, you wish you weren't at the theater. In a good movie, you go to the theater, you laugh, you enjoy the film, you come back home, and you go about with your life. In a great movie, the second you come out of the theater, you can't stop thinking about it and talking about it and you feel this yearning to share your feelings with the world on how much you love it and how much it means to you while feeling like you just can't communicate these feelings in a way that does your feelings justice. This is a great movie.Read moreShareRelated Answers SectionRelated AnswersBest reviews for OppenheimerIs Oppenheimer a good film?Impactful themes in OppenheimerWhy is Oppenheimer rated R?What makes Oppenheimer a visceral experience?New to Reddit?Create your account and connect with a world of communities.Continue with EmailContinue With Phone NumberBy continuing, you agree to ourUser Agreementand acknowledge that you understand thePrivacy Policy.PublicAnyone can view, post, and comment to this communityTop PostsRedditreReddit: Top posts of August 13, 2023RedditreReddit: Top posts of August 2023RedditreReddit: Top posts of 2023Reddit RulesPrivacy PolicyUser AgreementAccessibilityReddit, Inc. © 2025.

Its massive cast and even more massive director were just the tip ofOppenheimer’s hype iceberg. Christopher Nolan’s biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer was presented as the culmination of Nolan’s career unto this point. Nolan makes films of immense action centered around the figure of the lonely, shattered man, and the father of the atomic bomb was the perfect figure to serve as the apex of Nolan’s filmography. Along with that was Nolan’s cutting ties with Warner Brothers due to the theatrical mishandling of his last film, Tenet, which saw a simultaneous theatrical and streaming release. Nolan’s displeasure at Tenet’s release resulted in Universal buildingOppenheimer’s release around the theatre experience with emphasis on the 70mm and IMAX experience. All this coupled with the same day release of Barbie primedOppenheimerto be the cinematic event of the summer. My enthusiasm, however, did not match that of the general public.I have never been a big Nolan fan. I appreciate his technical mastery of the cinematic craft, yet I struggle to connect on a deeper level to any of his works. I consider him to be a talented director, but one whose repertoire comes across to me as dry and shallow. So understandably, upon hearing Christopher Nolan would be writing and directing a historical biopic about a topic as dark and complex as the creation of the atomic bomb, I didn’t get my hopes up. But as the release date grew closer, I found my excitement growing. By the time I was sitting in the theatre waiting for the show to begin, I had done a complete 180, and I was now looking forward toOppenheimer.I was ready for Nolan to grow past his character writing flaws and develop a film that truly defines his career as more than just an action filmmaker. And after 3 hours, to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.While I believeOppenheimerto be a hollow and messy experience, it does have its merits. Nolan continues to hone his technical abilities, and the results speak for themselves. The crowning sequence of the film is one of the most spectacular in Nolan’s 25-year career. His eye for spectacle is one of the strongest in Hollywood and his dedication to his craft is beyond admirable. The sequence in question is around 20 minutes and it uses every second. Its eventual catharsis of destruction and beauty is something that truly can only be captured by Nolan. His commitment to detail and dryness renders spectacle as something sublime. It pitches so hard into realism it becomes almost abstract within the landscape of cinema. The sequence is also aided by some incredible sound design, Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography, and Ludwig Goransson’s score. All three of those elements are the highlights of the entire film. It provides a rhythmic almost musical experience where destruction is rendered as an elemental dance. Structurally it mirrors Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia, where the sound and images function in more of a montage tradition than a standard narrative. So as an experience, it’s a fascinating exercise. The thumping score that meshes with the crisp sound all scoring some of the most striking imagery of the year, if there’s anything I can giveOppenheimer,it is most certainly an audiovisual triumph.Be that as it may, technical prowess alone cannot carry a film, and outside of impressive cinematic mastery,Oppenheimerfalls apart.One ofOppenheimer’s worst offenses is the worst part of any Nolan film, the character writing, particularly concerning the titular scientist.Oppenheimeris intended to come across as a conflicted character. His life is defined by moral conflicts concerning war, science, politics, love, and family,Oppenheimeris a mosaic of struggle. Nolan opts to portray these struggles as intentionally vague, but the effect is alienating rather than intriguing. Oppenheimer, the man, is fully realized. Each relationship, scientific achievement, decision, and struggle is explored with painstaking detail. However, Oppenheimer, the character, is non-existent. The reasoning behind any of his personal conflicts is nowhere to be found. The plot falls into place because that’s history, but it isn’t turned into a story. Oppenheimer’s relationships with the communist party, Jean, and his brother are key aspects of the film that never display the gravity they’re meant to possess. Nolan invites the audience to explore a complex character, but there’s nothing under the surface that warrants said exploration. As a character, Oppenheimer is simply a greatest hits compilation of the real scientist. The film doesn’t have anything to truly say about J. Robert Oppenheimer. After spending three hours with him I draw the same conclusions I would get from a Wikipedia article. Nolan takes the building blocks presented by Oppenheimer’s life but doesn’t draw a story from them. Nolan’s writing neglects meaningful character exploration. He attempts to draw depth from the situations the characters are in rather than the characters themselves. Nolan’s protagonists exist in a world, they don’t live in it, Oppenheimer is no different. Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer reacts to the volatile world with a thousand-yard stare, yet there’s no identity behind those eyes. As a biopic, it teaches the audience all about the wondrous science behind the destruction, but the complex emotion behind it is simply telegraphed without ever materializing. With a story as dense as that of the atomic bomb, Nolan’s typical “silent man with a problem” ends up collapsing any meaning behind the film. Emotional engagement is drawn from the film’s mirroring of real events, not from any modicum of cinematic practice. For me as an audience member, I expected more than a recreation of events, but Nolan tries to point me in the other direction. He expects the audience to be moved through events alone, without ever needing to develop a character, and for a film likeOppenheimer,that does not suffice.Nolan’s realism also ends up shooting himself in the foot. The true story of Oppenheimer is one that demands respect and heft, but Nolan’s adherence to this drab atmosphere becomes exhausting. In an attempt to be bleak, the film becomes so self-serious it borders on parody. Nolan’s aversion to brevity is expected, but in this case, it leads to some truly baffling decisions. Multiple scenes are borderline comical yet are treated with utmost sincerity. While believing in your story is vital, it seems like Nolan insists upon himself. Scenes such as the one of Jean and Robert having sex in a courtroom is ridiculously out of place, but Nolan’s inclusion of it seems to argue that it’s vital to the story. It loses itself in its own bleakness and becomes out of touch. Moments like Albert Einstein emerging from the dark to dispense advice like Nick Fury in Iron Man are laughable, butOppenheimeris a film that cannot see past itself. Every moment is engineered for maximum realism, but instead of reflecting reality, it becomes a tedious exercise of how truly out of touch a film can become.However,Oppenheimer’s biggest flaw lies in its very subject matter. Much of my trepidation going intoOppenheimerwas a result of Christopher Nolan dissecting a topic as devastating and terrifying as the use of the atomic bomb in the Second World War. And to me, my trepidation was extremely warranted.Oppenheimeris a film far too busy to do justice to any of its themes, let alone one like the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nolan’s approach to thematic storytelling is based in a very “tell don’t show” tradition. In films likeThe Dark Knight,it swiftly cuts through exposition so we can quicker experience massive action set pieces. But inOppenheimerall it does is dilute any sense of thematic depth. It’s dialogue heavy, but the dialogue doesn’t further anything, it just introduces idea upon idea until it ends. Instead of delving into established themes,Oppenheimerintroduces another one. Each idea is just 3 others in a trench coat, with none ever amounting to anything substantial. Everything simply happens because it must, not leaving space for the film to come to any conclusions or meaningful commentary. Its hollowness is buried in its busyness, masquerading pointless noise as profundity. What it ends up doing is constantly introducing a theme then immediately undercutting it. Politics, family, friends, religion, patriotism, sex, evil, war, all of these define the film, but nothing defines these themes. The more I find myself attempting to surmise meaning, the less I discover. For an action film, that’s fine, but for a film as heavy asOppenheimer,that won’t fly.The evil of Hiroshima is something once again commodified in Nolan’s thematic structure. Nolan mitigates the impact of the bombings to make room for his other ideas. The weight of these actions is then briefly explored in a handful of vignettes and the ending. It’s framed through a lens of Oppenheimer’s personal struggles with his hand in its creation, but also with the rest of his struggles. Nolan’s thematic stitching attempts to complicate the conflict of the bombings, but it completely undermines it. The death of millions is added to a file folder of “Oppenheimer’s problems” and it sits alongside issues like “nagging wife” and “being too smart”. To add dimension to this conflict by way of personal experience is compelling, but to Nolan, dimension is added by convoluting the subject. The tragedy of Hiroshima is contorted to fit into Nolan’s intellectual puzzle that strips it of dramatic heft and shaves off the difficult to swallow edges. Themes are made to fit with each other, not to develop meaningfully beyond the film. Is it cinematic? One could argue, yes. Is it artistic? I wouldn’t say so. It’s not a method of learning or understanding through an artistic lens, it’s a presentation of a real tragedy that favors being economic over being meaningful. The ending packs a punch, but I don’t credit that to the film. My knowledge of the Manhattan project increased, and my fear of nuclear destruction was rekindled, but the man behind the camera had nothing to do with that. As an independent artistic experience,Oppenheimerdoesn’t offer anything unique or meaningful on the subject. It’s a faint repetition of reality in a glossy package.WhileOppenheimerseems to be a hit among critics and audiences alike, I myself am not caught up in the rapturous reception. To me,Oppenheimeris everything a modern blockbuster shouldn’t be. It demands to be taken seriously as an unmatched artistic achievement purely on face value. A big cast, IMAX, a legendary director, technical proficiency, and a larger-than-life subject does not make a masterpiece.Oppenheimeris a film that, for me, is propped up on toothpicks, but the minute I delve into it, it collapses. Nolan has made a film with a sturdy skeleton and nothing holding it together. It loudly exclaims meaning, demanding that it be deemed a masterpiece, but under the noise there is a deafening silence. A film that has a lot to talk about but nothing to say. Christopher Nolan seems to have it in his head thatOppenheimerwas always destined to be his opus, and as a result didn’t bother to clean up or refine his style. The story of the atomic bomb is one that deserves attention, a historical landmark at the crossroads of science of morality.Oppenheimeris a film that takes a complex idea and films it, without ever doing anything more. Many have found themselves profoundly moved byOppenheimer,so I wouldn’t say skip it, but for me,Oppenheimeris a three-hour whirlwind that rages as loud as it can but leaves the landscape unchanged.PS: If you’re looking for films about the devastating effects of the atomic bombing on Japan, I recommendGrave of the FirefliesandHiroshima Mon Amour,two brilliant films that tackle the idea with complexities and nuance that I didn’t see reflected inOppenheimer.ReviewsFeaturedRecent PostsSee All\"Honey Don't!\" - The Most Depressing \"Comedy\" Of the YearSpike Lee's \"Highest 2 Lowest:\" Money, Morality, and New York CityNot Worth the Wait: \"Americana\" Rides In Too LateCinemasters©2021 by Cinemastersbottom of page\n",

Sherwin tell us inAmerican Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer(London: Atlantic Books, 2005). The book is the account of Oppenheimer’s life and works on which Christopher Nolan’s latest film,Oppenheimer, a biopic of the physicist who gave us the terror of the atomic bomb, is based.Oppenheimer’s life was one lived, as Bird and Sherwin recount, as “a theoretical physicist who displayed the charismatic qualities of a great leader, an aesthete who cultivated ambiguities,” and yet he was at once also, in the years since those first bombs exploded in Japan and continuing decades beyond his death, a person “shrouded in controversy, myth, and mystery.” He was “a symbol,” fellow physicist Hideki Yukawa, Japan’s first Nobel Prize winner said, of the “tragedy of the modern nuclear scientist.”Nolan’s masterful film isnotan enigma, thankfully, even if Oppenheimer was. It is instead a beautiful virtuosic piece of dramatic cinema capturing all of this and more about the man, his work, his professional and personal relationships, and his legacy, and with all the seriousness and characteristic flare of a Nolan film project that should appeal to virtually any viewer regardless of interests.  I, being scientifically minded since early childhood and especially regarding physics, found the film positively riveting – all 3 hours of it.  I recommend it heartily, like many other reviewers giving it universal acclaim, and for a variety of reasons, most of them surely relevant to us all.Photo: Universal PicturesChristopher Nolan has made his name and reputation with a long list of widely lauded works since his debut,Following, which was a 1998, 1 hour and 9 minute black and white mystery thriller made for less than half a million pounds, of which most reading this will not have heard.That aside, even the semi-regular filmgoerwillknow most of Nolan’s works as producer, director, or both, such a popular impact have they had. His best known projects to date includeMemento(2000),Insomnia(2002),Batman Begins(2005),The Prestige(2006),The Dark Knight(2008)—for which Heath Ledger won a well-deserved posthumous Oscar portraying Batman’s nemesis the Joker—Inception(2010),The Dark Knight Rises(2012),Interstellar(2014),Dunkirk(2017),Tenet(2020), and nowOppenheimer(2023). He has acted as producer on other films likeMan of Steel(2013 – who knew?),Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016),Justice League(2017), andZach Snyder’s Justice League(2021), his connection to these latter projects as producer or executive producer barely recognized. Nolan’s giftedness for the film art form is such that he has also written many of these for the screen, includingOppenheimer, this newest creation penned in collaboration with Oppenheimer’s biographers Bird and Sherwin.Nolan has even invented equipment, should he envision a new way of doing something, of wresting from the creative processes something that he wants to make happen. He crafted a special lens forThe Dark Knight, for instance, so revolutionary that fellow filmmakers J. J. Abrams and Zach Snyder begged him to borrow it for their work.ForOppenheimer, continuing this pioneering trend, Nolan had Kodak create a new and special type of black and white film to fit his preferred 70mm IMAX format. Throughout the course of the story, his direction dances between black and white and colour segments to help us follow the storylines from various points of view.  The effect is so striking, the black and white so immaculate in Nolan’s format, that others will again want to use this technology so effective in the telling ofOppenheimer.And what storytelling it is, and with what notable acting talent to help Nolan tell it. Cillian Murphy, who has acted for Nolan in theBatmantrilogy and most recentlyDunkirk, plays Oppenheimer. Murphy captures the attested complexities of the man well, including his tortured pathos as relayed in Bird and Sherwin’s book and by numerous personal reports. Such pathos was embedded in Oppenheimer’s complicated psyche long before he helped to create the bomb and realised what terrible powers of destruction he had helped to accomplish and unleash. When Murphy utters Oppenheimer’s famous quotation from Vishnu in the Bhagavad-Gita, ‘Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,’ we sense the scientist’s bizarre mix of elation and shock at the achievement, seeing it on the actor’s gaunt and haunted face. Murphy reportedly starved himself, routinely avoiding meals with his fellow actors on the set to become the pained Oppenheimer incarnate.  Oppenheimer was always by common account a quite tortured soul, and this grew to palpable levels following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  He felt, and in many ways literally was, personally responsible for making such destruction possible, which he quickly realised could literally end the world entirely, should people act irresponsibly with the then newfound fire from the gods. Some have called the film a work of horror so replete is this aspect throughout it, and so vividly portrayed.Oppenheimer’s tremendous sense of guilt and angst was shared by at least some others drafted in to work on the assignment, like the eventual fellow Nobel laureate Richard Feynman. Feynman temporarily stopped his Princeton PhD in physics to help with the so-called Manhattan Project based at the secret laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico (1943–45), where he was the youngest group leader in the theoretical division. Feynman agreed to join because he realised that if Americans were attempting to produce such a dreadful weapon, others like the Nazis must be trying to do the same; and they were. Decades later, on an episode of the BBC’sHorizonprogramme dedicated to the by then famous Feynman, which I have also watched for this review (‘The Pleasure of Finding Things Out’, 23 November 1981), he admitted that the achievement of the bomb pushed him into a dark depression such that he balked even at seeing simple construction projects like bridges being built around his hometown, New York City. “I had a very strong reaction after the war, of a peculiar nature,” Feynman recounted.  “I remember thinking that things were … sort of doomed, because already it appeared to me, earlier than to others who were more optimistic, that international relations and the way people were behaving was no different than it had ever been before. And I was sure it [the atomic bomb] was therefore going to be used very soon … and I thought, really believed, that it was senseless to makeanythingbecause it would all be destroyed very soon anyway.”As the film depicts, it was in fact not actually known with certainty whether the explosion of even a single nuclear weapon at the level of clandestine development and testing might set off a nuclear chain reaction that could keep going and destroy the planet. There is a fleeting humorous moment offsetting the otherwise unceasingly intense film as the characters consider this unthinkable possible scenario. Murphy’s Oppenheimer admits to Matt Damon’s General Leslie Groves, who was ultimately in charge of the military project, the prospect:Leslie Groves: “Are you saying that there's a chance that when we push that button... we destroy the world?”J. Robert Oppenheimer: “The chances are near zero... “Leslie Groves: “Nearzero?”J. Robert Oppenheimer: “What do you want from theory alone?”Leslie Groves: “Zerowould be nice!”In truth, Oppenheimer’s reassuring ‘near zero’ was a stretch of faith, as some physicists on the Los Alamos site were actively taking bets over whether this would actually happen.Flanking the instantly recognizable Murphy and Damon playing Oppenheimer and Groves, the cast of characters played by quite a long list of additionally familiar actors reads like a who’s who of the quantum physics revolution. Granted, perhaps one does have to be a physics geek like me to find the 180-minute extravaganza as exciting as I did. Yet there were hardly any great physicists of the 20thcentury, of whom most educated people will have heard whether scientifically-inclined or not, who were not portrayed: Murphy as Oppenheimer, Kenneth Branagh as Niels Bohr (of Copenhagen interpretation fame), James D'Arcy as Oppenheimer’s Cambridge professor Patrick Blackett (whom Oppenheimer hated so much he left on his desk a deadly poisoned apple hoping to kill him, before later retrieving it in a panic), Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Matthias Schweighöfer as Werner Heisenberg, Jack Quaid as Feynman and, gloriously, really too many other important scientists and acclaimed actors to name here. Other actors portraying key people in the nucleus of Oppenheimer’s personal life include Emily Blunt as his equally brilliant wife Kitty, and Oxford’s own Florence Pugh—whose father owns several restaurants in town—playing Oppenheimer’s suicidal lover, Jean Tatlock. I have no question but that some of these people will be nominated for awards following this film, and really should win them.Credit: Universal PicturesI have noted why I saw the film – I teach and publish on areas like quantum mechanics in the light of philosophy and religion, and simply love the subject area, which is as much pleasure as work to me. I take physics and related books on holiday to read by remote Italian swimming pools.  But why shouldyoubother, all of the above thus far aside?  There are at least three reasons applicable to all.First,Oppenheimerdepicts the making of human history that will have impacted everyone.Have you not heard Vladimir Putin in recent months in the news threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine? Oppenheimer and his colleagues made this possible. Forget global warming for a second, before certainly remembering it again. The practically immediate destruction of the entire planet is possible, and humanity has had enough nuclear weapons to do so many times over long since 1945. By the early 2020s there now exist an estimated 13,410 nuclear weapons in the world, which is a figure lower than at a peak of 70,000 at the height of the Cold War of the mid-1980s.  The Federation of American Scientists records that more than 90 percent of the totality of nuclear weapons is owned by only two countries, the United States and Russia. The remainder are held ready to use, if necessary, by France, China, the United Kingdom, Israel, Pakistan, India, and North Korea, with countries like Iran attempting to build their own.The film will teach you something about science and its real-world impact that you may not have otherwise known.I am still buzzing from the scene where someone bursts into Oppenheimer’s classroom in 1938, a year before Hitler invaded Poland, to inform everyone present that a small team of German scientists had somehow managed to split a uranium atom. Oppenheimer at first thought this impossible, before eventually designing weapons based on such a truthful reality. Such nuclear fission (the act or process of splitting the nucleus of an atom to release a large amount of energy) is today also a useful source of energy, and nuclear fusion (the act or process of combining the nuclei of atoms to form a heavier nucleus to release a large amount of energy) shows promise, if made viable, of being the greatest energy revolution ever conceived.Following these reasons, the film can have important implications for theology, philosophy, and religion broadly.Did you know that the first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on the Christian feast day of The Transfiguration of our Lord, held on 6 August annually worldwide? There must be something to say about that apparent perversion, one event described by eyewitnesses as a deadly light brighter than the sun, and the other when Jesus’s disciples say that they witnessed his transfiguration while praying on a mountain. ‘And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white’ (Matthew 17.2). Oppenheimer himself named the atomic testing site ‘Trinity’, though he claimed not to remember why later.  Ethical questions have no end when people can so destroy themselves and others, needless to say. And broader religious studies questions are brought to bear by Oppenheimer’s personal fascination with Hinduism. He taught himself Sanskrit and read the Bhagavad-Gita in it, hence quoting Vishnu upon realising the weight of building the first atomic weapons. He considered ‘The Lord’s Song’ from the ancient text ‘the most beautiful philosophical song existing in any known tongue’, and gave copies of the Gita as gifts to friends.The film is far from warmongering, should anyone worry. The central theme is arguably the life-long horror that men like Oppenheimer, and his friend Feynman, felt upon realising what they had done. Oppenheimer so repented of it that he spent the rest of his life campaigningagainstthe use of atomic weapons, and so much so that he was put on trial as a suspected Communist by his own fellow Americans.While I won’t ruin it for you, the ending of the film is haunting and affecting along these lines.Is Nolan’sOppenheimera work of genius as some say?  It is doubtless a mature display of great artistic and technical skill. Nolan can make not so great films after all, likeTenet, which has the same panache, but does a terrible job of explaining the physics at its heart. For a Nolan masterpiece comparable toOppenheimerseeInterstellarif you have not yet.  I’ve watched that at least a dozen times to date.And by all means do seeOppenheimer– all 3 hours of it.  Also, do read the book by Bird and Sherwin on which it is heavily based – and all 721 pages of that as I did for this review, partly because I found the subject matter as fascinating as the film.I want to seeOppenheimeragain.Dr. Shaun Hensonis a Departmental Lecturer in Science and Religion at the Faculty of Theology and Religion.Current Students and Staff:Course HandbooksStaff Intranet (SharePoint)Student Hub (SharePoint)Lecture ListLibraryOxTalksCanvasQuick Links:Undergraduate StudyGraduate StudyMembershipVacanciesContact UsIcon: Facebook.

All those years of teaching and exploring Arms Control and Disarmament finally became relevant in my current career. The story of the Manhattan Project is fascinating, as was the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose scope I doubt even three hours can completely cover. But given my general love of Christopher Nolan’s work [seeInceptionandDunkirk], I knew I could not miss this one.So to set the scene, the world is at war as Germany marches across Europe and Japan across the Pacific. This is already a dangerous predicament, but the world of theoretical physics has been running leaps and bounds forward, and everyone can see the endpoint, a bomb, a bomb of devastating potential. What happens if the Nazis get a bomb that can destroy cities? As the world scrambles, only one person in America can lead the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy). However, his past might contain more problems than the government can handle.It is a complex look at a complicated man . Image Credit: Universal Pictures.Many people should getbiopicsmade of their lives, but I must admit that J. Robert Oppenheimer is the perfect choice for this kind of inspection. He had a wild personal life, alongside being one of the key people in a scientific discovery that changed the world and whose ripples we are still dealing with today. He is a complex character in his own right, but to add the complications of that nuclear legacy, well, you have the scope to look at something truly fascinating. It could have been too much for a less experienced filmmaker to capture everything you needed, but Christopher Nolan and their team did not miss.I can’t begin to discuss this film without talking about a cast so stacked that Gary Oldman is in this film and is not even in the top-10 billing. Cillian Murphy has to carry so much of this film, and even with all that weight on his shoulders, you feel the professionalism and need to capture the reality of every moment. The life of J. Robert Oppenheimer is full of complexities, both good and bad, and I feel that Cillian captured all of those nuances in his performance. For a while, I wondered if they were doing anything of major substance with Emily Blunt, who plays Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer, only for the film to reveal that they 100% knew why they were casting Emily.There is not a weak link in the extensive cast. Image Credit: Universal Pictures.However, this does not stop with our two leads. Every person in this film gives pitch-perfect performances, even if they are only in for one or two scenes. Robert Downey Jr. plays Lewis Strauss and is probably the second anchor point for the film, which is good because this might be some of the best work, I have seen from him in a while, and you hold on to his every word. Matt Damon plays Leslie Groves who comes in to try and keep this project from flying off the rails and has a mostly calming effect on the film. Florence Pugh probably has the hardest performance in the movie, and I viscerally felt the pain of her character Jean Tatlock. This also includes perhaps the most awkward sex scene I have seen in a film in recent memory. But this is just scratching the surface of the acting in this film. With Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz, Jack Quaid, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke, and you know what? Look, the whole ensemble cast is giving masterful performances here.In recent films, Christopher Nolan has always liked to play with the notion of time, and I wondered how he would explore that in what is a straightforward narrative compared to films likeInterstellar. He achieves this by interlacing the general drive forward towards the Trinity Test with his past and future. It can be difficult to follow a film when it jumps back and forth between its internal timeline, but I was never lost. Part of this was because they chose to film the different sections in slightly different styles, so you always had a visual anchor for where you were meant to be. This led to some interesting choices, like having future events from the film’s perspective be in black-and-white when you usually would reserve that for sections set in the past. But this helps frame the movie from Robert’s perspective and create a visual language to help support the narrative.Oppenheimer uses visual language to help support the written narrative. Image Credit: Universal Pictures.Which leads us to the visual presentation and what a visually stunning film this is. It has very stylised depictions of all the nuclear processes, but you get absorbed into this world where flames become part of the visual language of the film. The whole lead-up to the Trinity Test had me on the edge of my seat, with silence and roar being used in equal measures to captivate me. This is supported by what I think might be my favourite musical score that Ludwig Göransson has made. Those brass notes rumble through your chairs, making you feel the film. There were some moments where I wished they tweaked the sound mix or added subtitles, but thankfully this was not nearly as much a problem as it was in the past.However, as the film progressed, an issue latched on to me, and I could not shake it as I was processing the film. One of the things that I was pleasantly surprised about was just how into the weeds it went with the issues around the political realities of the time, of the different ways to make a nuclear weapon with discussions about gun and implosion-type weapons. Yes, that story about Kyoto actually happened. We even get deep into the weeds of Robert’s life, including when he tries to poison someone with a laced apple. However, when it came to discussing ethics around nuclear weapons, it felt like the film didn’t go far enough to engage with what happened to the people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Oppenheimer is a visual masterpeice. Image Credit: Universal Pictures.We get discussions about the political reality of the strikes, scientists’ fears about them, and even Robert’s own internal dilemmas, but it is all reaction and not reality. I know this will be a more personal note here, but having experienced the deeply emotional Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, I could not help but feel there were missed opportunities. We got Robert quoting the Bhagavad Gita  with “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds”. I just wish we also got Kenneth Bainbridge’s (Josh Peck) “Now we are all sons of bitches.” I will also say the last 45 minutes were something I loved about the film, but given how long the movie is, I think this shift will be a hard sell for many.In the end, do we recommendOppenheimer? Absolutely. While there were some issues with it that I can’t push away. That does not take away from the visual excellence and masterclass performances on show here. They captured a time and a place, but more importantly, they delved into the complexities of a complex person and didn’t shy away from what they found. If you likedOppenheimer, we would recommend to youRocketman.By Brian MacNamara: You can follow Brian on TwitterHere, when he’s not chatting about Movies and TV, he’ll be talking about International Relations, or the Solar System.Have you watched Oppenheimer?, let us know what you thought in the comments below, feel free to share this review on any of the social medias and you can follow usHere.

Not so unusual when you recall that fervour that had swept across moviegoing audiences this summer of 2023 regarding two concurrent but diametrically opposite film releases:BarbieandOppenheimer, known together affectionately as ‘Barbenheimer’.WhileBarbieis clearly leading the race globally, Oppenheimer has been no slouch either with a 80 million dollar box office opening. In India however, interestingly enough, it has been Christopher Nolan’s biopic which is the clear winner. Whether that is an indication of Nolan’s popularity or how the Indian audience perceives ṭhe clearly feminist narrative ofBarbieremains to be seen, butOppenheimerremains deeply popular into its third week, with sold out seats in most major movie halls.In India, it has been Christopher Nolan’s biopic which is the clear winner.This is what I witnessed as well – an almost full movie hall for a movie which I thought was going to be a slow character examination, albeit one with two atom bombs. AndOppenheimeris that, as much as it is a number of other things. At times, it approaches a  hagiography rather than a biography, occasionally morphing into a fast paced thriller. But above all, it is both the creation of and entanglement of the myth of the man who history has come to call The Father of the Atom Bomb.The film is about the life of the scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, his role in the creation of the atom bomb, as well as his subsequent work on nuclear policy as well as the trial through which he finally lost his security clearance with the government of America (an incident which not only devastated him, but also his family; years later, his daughter would commit suicide over it.) It also paints a picture of America at the beginning of the Atomic Age till the run up to the Cold War: the time of risingMcCarthyism.At times, it approaches a  hagiography rather than a biography, occasionally morphing into a fast paced thriller.My prevailing thought throughout the three-hour run of the movie is how little space there was in the movie for anyone else except Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy). With a few exceptions, there is almost no frame in the movie which isn’t dominated by Murphy’s lanky frame and the exceptions almost all include politician Lewis Straus, as played by Robert Downey Jr. I’ll say little about his role so as to avoid spoiling the reader (as much as it is possible to avoid spoiling an historical event) but safe to say that post Marvel, RDJ is finally getting to flex those acting muscles in ways he fully relishes.Among the other notable exceptions are the truly excellent performances given by both Emily Blunt and Gary Oldman; the latter appearing in only a single scene-stealing moment as President Harry Truman and the former in a number of powerful but underrated moments as Kitty Oppenheimer.Oppenheimerhas no shortage of famous actors (no surprise for a Nolan movie) with the likes of Florence Pugh, Jack Quaid, Rami Malek to name a few, but all of them fall into the sidelines next to the main character itself.There is almost no frame in the movie which isn’t dominated by Murphy’s lanky frameAnd that is not down to Cillian Murphy himself necessarily, acting powerhouse though he may be. Rather, there is little breathing room for other characters to exist, unless they are relevant to Oppenheimer in that particular moment in his life. Scenes flash by, cut quickly so that one event leads to another but very few people linger long enough to make an impression outside of Oppenheimer himself. I was surprised to find towards the end of the movie that Jack Quaid, ofThe Boysfame, played celebrated physicist Richard Feynman. I had missed it in the quick pacing of the movie.On one hand, I admire it because this is clearly the vision for the film – it is, after all, calledOppenheimerand notThe Manhattan Project. But on the other hand, it also feels like too much ‘world building’ (for lack of a better word) or character knowledge is left for the reader to put together with too few pieces. For example: the women in Oppenheimer’s circuit exist around him to be both bolster him and tear him down alternatively, but he remains central to their lives despite everything; he offhandedly reveals that he has been cheating on his current wife with at least two different women at different points; while presenting a new house, his wife notices there is no kitchen, revealing his lack of knowledge (and interest) in knowing anything in the running of a home.The women in Oppenheimer’s circuit exist around him to be both bolster him and tear him down alternatively, but he remains central to their lives despite everything.All of these scenes exist for a reason, to show Oppenheimer as a flawed man but it falls a little flat against the movie’s overbearing tendency toalsobuild him up as a mythical figure. At one point, when told by a fellow scientist to take off the military jacket he is wearing and dress like himself, he changes in his room to his trademark hat and coat. This scene is accompanied by the camera gently dwelling on his back as he adjusts his hat with the music swelling to match the almost superhero-like imagery – the myth settling into his legend.That’s the other thing withOppenheimer– it is not a subtle film. And this is disappointing because as much as Nolan seems willing to let the audience put together pieces elsewhere, he seems as afraid that they will miss some crucial element of Oppenheimer’s mental state and overcorrects by literally spelling it out. When Oppenheimer is presenting before a hostile committee which will eventually reject his security clearance, it is clear that he feels naked and exposed in front of them – and that is exactly what the camera shows him as, naked and exposed. It was a moment that made me roll my eyes.That’s the other thing withOppenheimer– it is not a subtle film.This sort of over-the-top display works in the film’s favour when it comes to its big moments, such as the Trinity test itself: the first detonation of a nuclear weapon. The slow buildup to the bomb, itself a looming invisible presence the entire film, being hoisted up for the drop; it’s eventual detonation, the first completely silent flash followed by the roar of sound and the shock wave – it was a pivotal moment in the film and it stayed with the audience, as it did with me. Another moment, surprisingly subtle by itself, was when a pilot describes flying past a missile in the dead of the night and the viewer is shown it exactly as it happened – a beautiful moment encased in a horrifying realisation at what is to follow.There is a lack, a hole, in the filmOppenheimerand in the days before the release of the film, this resulted in a firestorm of discourse on social media. In a film made about the man who helped make one of the most infamous weapons in human history, where are its victims? What about the bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, what about its people? What about its consequences? Why does the film not dwell onthat?This sort of over-the-top display works in the film’s favour when it comes to its big moments, such as the Trinity test itself.Having watched the film (and also noted the conspicuous gap), I would argue that the film is aware of this lack and, for good or bad, it’s a deliberate choice. In a moment of Nolanesque un-subtlety, addressing a large crowd cheering for him, Oppenheimer sees a replica of the effects of the bomb on the crowd in front of him: heat radiation burning through grotesquely smiling people as their skin melts off their bodies. Walking away from the crowd, he steps through the pulverised burnt corpse of a child and looks down at it, uncomprehending.But this is not a movie about the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. (One can argue that others, including Japanese directors themselves, have made films reflecting on this traumatic event of history, such asBarefoot Gen, Hiroshima Mon Amour,or even Ishiro Honda’sGodzillawhere the titular monster is an allegory for the bomb and the devastation that followed.)  This movie, however, is about Oppenheimer, the man and till the end, that is the conviction the movie sticks to even when it is doing it no favours. It is Oppenheimer that the camera focuses on when he is watching a film on the effects the atom bomb had on the victims in Japan. It is Oppenheimer whose moral revulsions are shown affecting his own stance on nuclear policy post World-War II.This movie, however, is about Oppenheimer, the man and till the end, that is the conviction the movie sticks to even when it is doing it no favours.It is strange to accuse a film named after its main character of being too much in love with its main character. At times,Oppenheimerdoes come across like that. At other times, it seems committed to apparently unflinchingly showing the truth of the man and his decisions: his wishy-washy political leanings, his own tendency to throw friends under the bus, his mistreatment of the women in his life. But the first half the film is spent in firmly building him up as a hero and the second half in trying to set him up as a flawed martyr. The end result is a man who exists as a semi-tragic figure in front of the camera and how much that sense of tragedy is earned remains a point of uncertainty for me.friday feminist reviewsOppenheimerLeave A Comment.Leave a ReplyCancel replyYour email address will not be published.Required fields are marked*Comment*Name*Email*WebsiteAuthor.Saswati ChatterjeeSaswati Chatterjee is Assistant Manager - Digital Engagement at Breakthrough India.Subscribe.Receive a bi-monthly update on events, campaigns & other news that interests you.Categories.Books2By Team Change Leaders11Editorial33Framing Change19Friday Feminist Reviews66FYI92History7Impact Stories34In Focus189Movies23Music1Newsletter29The Breakthrough Voice368हिंदी131Contribute.Write for us, become a contributor to the Breakthrough blog.Connect.Get Involved.Join the generation that is working to make the world equal and violence free.Donate.E-Volunteer.Work With Us.Get To Know UsOur PeopleOur WorkBT ValuesStrengthOur BoardBT Internal UpdateContact UsGet InvolvedDonateWork With UsE – VolunteerChampions For ChangeMedia CentreCampaignsMedia KitsBreakthrough NewsletterOur WebinarsViolence is Not FilmyReports / ResearchPress ReleasesResearch & Evaluation ReportsTool KitsAnnual Reports & Legal DocumentsImpact ReportsRelevant LinksFAQsSitemapTerms & ConditionsPoliciesStop Recurring Donation RequestJoin Taaron ki ToliPartnershipLife Skills CollaborativePunjab PartnershipCovid Sheroes© 2025 Breakthrough Trust.

Robert Oppenheimerby authors Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. But while there’s much to appreciate and plenty to praise, the sum is a hot mess.This image released by Universal Pictures shows Cillian Murphy in a scene from \"Oppenheimer.\" (Universal Pictures via AP)© Universal Studios. All Rights Reserved.Nolan’s three-hour R-rated historical drama is squarely focused on adult audiences, mostly men, and opens against pop culture sensationBarbieand returning box office championMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One. The runtime means less screenings per day, butOppenheimerhas exclusive access to IMAX for several weeks, and trends show we currently lack enough premium theaters to meet high audience demand. So, the three-hour length is somewhat mitigated by the larger number of — and longer run in — IMAX locations.Barbielooks to top $150+ million worldwide through Sunday, whileMission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part Oneis expected to finish somewhere near $400+/- million in global receipts after its sophomore weekend.Oppenheimer, meanwhile, is looking at right around $100 million.Older-skewing films have struggled lately, for the most part, especially tentpoles. Already this year, Disney’sIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyhad a tough time appealing outside of its narrow target demos, andThe Flash— which counted in part on nostalgic appeal for Michael Keaton’s return as Batman — was a disaster for Warner Bros. Discovery. Other high-profile 2023 films targeted mostly to adult audiences, such as80 For BradyandBook Club: The Next Chapter, likewise had difficulty winning over viewers.Forbes15 Year Retrospective: 'The Dark Knight' Was The First Billion Dollar Superhero MovieByMark HughesMORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024ByKevin PayneContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024ByCassidy HortonContributorEvenMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, which is performing well and earned a series-best opening, still came in under expectations and needs a good hold this weekend to prove it can sustain a long-legged run and benefit from generous international returns like its predecessors.So we’ll see whetherOppenheimercan please its target audience enough to earn good enough word of mouth to drive strong business and break into other demographics besides primarily middle-aged white men.With a film this long and of this sort, everything relies heavily on word of mouth and reviews. If reviews are bad, it needs overwhelmingly great word of mouth to do better than just a respectable first wave of audiences on opening weekend.If reviews are good, it needs at least very good audience word of mouth to overcome the portion of potential viewers who do care about buzz and reviews, who will show up at theaters this weekend and ask themselves, “What will I see? Hmm, which one is supposed to be good?” and recall what they heard from friends/family and what they saw on Rotten Tomatoes.Luckily for Nolan and Universal Pictures, so far reviews are highly positive. The Cinemascore will tell us how audiences feel, and the combo of the two should paint a fairly clear picture at least for the short term. A B+ grade will suggest weak support in its most enthusiastic viewers — opening weekend fans and those who show up because they were inspired by the buzz and marketing — and thus I’d expect a disappointing overall showing for the film at the end of its box office run.An A or A+ is what everyone involved in the picture most wants to hear, and would suggest a run similar perhaps to Nolan’s previous pictureDunkirk, another historic true story that earned widespread acclaim and is the filmmaker’s greatest achievement to date.ForbesCritic Identifies The Secret Ingredients That Make Screenwriters Better Than A.I.ByMark HughesA grade of A- is the hardest to parse here, as it could swing either way and would largely depend on how international audiences react to the picture. I suspect it will perform well in certain countries, far worse in others, and might not even screen in some markets.For now, it’s hard for me to say where I think the results will wind up, because my reaction toOppenheimeris different from most other critics, apparently.Oppenheimeris ambitious and includes many mesmerizing, often brilliant moments, but those moments cannot sustain themselves nor find common ground as a single compelling narrative or perspective. Despite seemingly global and even cosmic themes, it winds up feeling decidedly contained and restricted, eyes cast downward, abandoning any visionary search for higher meaning behind the processes of science or politics.The marketing implies this is the story of the USA’s creation of the atomic bomb during World War II, and much mystery and buzz surrounds how Nolan depicts the eventual successful test of the atom bomb. Which would indeed have been a great story to tell, especially with hints that Nolan’s movie was a sort of “mad scientist” version of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the bomb. And in certain moments — far too few and largely restricted to brief early scenes , as it turns out — the film takes on an expressionist, surrealist quality when giving us early glimpses into Oppenheimer’s fascination with quantum theory and its implications.Forbes'Mission: Impossible' Sequel Tops $100+ Million Worldwide Today At Box OfficeByMark HughesHowever, while it’s technically true that the film contains and returns constantly to a generally clinical presentation of scientific highlight moments during the creation of secretive Los Alamos, the main stories are not the bomb. Los Alamos is the backdrop against which the three main stories are told — his romantic life and affairs, the post-war attempts by his enemies to get his security clearance revoked, and an even later period of time when Lewis Strauss faced Congressional hearings to confirm him for a presidential cabinet position and his history of collaboration and conflict with Oppenheimer was a central focus.Too much screen time (relatively speaking) is dedicated to either Oppenheimer’s romantic and sexual relationships, in which women are portrayed as unreasonable, histrionic, mentally ill, and/or incapable of appreciating/accepting the demands and pressures he was under. Even the few women in the cast who aren’t Oppenheimer’s romantic interests or affairs — specifically, women on the team at Los Alamos — get little to say or are used to present positions and assertions framed as naive or overly simplistic compared against the turmoil and more complicated, serious considerations and burdens of “the great man.”It feels like a series of “this happened, and then this happened,” scenes collecting events from his life to form some sort of collage, with the parts then mixed into random orders and competing stories, all represented in different ways — more modern moments are black and white, older events in traditional “dramatic period piece” style, and mid-era events a starker almost sizzling representation of 1960s or 1970s newsreel.I can appreciate using different approaches to distinguish different eras and/or to try to fit the feel of those particular times, but it feels like either the decisions were made at random or — and I’m not sure if this would be better or worse, depending on how much you do or don’t agree with any of the film’s various competing perspectives — to intentionally present Strauss’ storyline in absolute black-and-white terms, present the hearings against Oppenheimer as conspiratorial and too literally glaring in their hypocrisy, and to present the Los Alamos backstory in a gentler, reverent manner.Perhaps Nolan’s attempt here is to create a cinematic representation of Oppenheimer’s life story that replicates quantum theory in certain regards — mixing up the timelines and jumping between them unequally and unpredictably (including because the editing is at times clipped and jarring), using varying and contrasting color and photographic techniques, switching between his more straightforward classic filmmaking approaches and almost experimental methods of photography and sound and editing (especially in the first act, and then later during a few climactic bomb-related sequences), and having storylines that converge and diverge sometimes in sync and other times at random.Is this Nolan’s expression of time existing at all moments simultaneously, so to speak? Is this how the chaos and confusion and mystery of quantum theory looks when distilled through artistry of filmmaking and representing someone who dedicated their life to quantum pursuits?ForbesFilm Critic's Picks: Top 20 Best Movies About Unions And Labor StrikesByMark HughesHard to say, because if not then he merely adapted a biography and attempted to include too many threads that each might’ve held its own appeal but which don’t fit together well in the form he’s created here, which would be a failure of adaptation.If so, though, then he attempted to adapt a biography by including so many threads that each held its own appeal and which fit together haphazardly and chaotically on the screen but which are still all part of the same lived life, and all of this chaos and all of those various threads are part of the larger story revolving around the central axis that is the introduction of nuclear weapons to our world.That this is both a remarkable scientific achievement and a potential guarantee that humanity is doomed, then, would speak profoundly to the issues that plagued Oppenheimer in this telling and represent humanity’s nature to make miraculous discoveries and then learn all of the wrong lessons from them.Sadly,Oppenheimerdoesn’t rise to the occasion in the latter regard, if that was the intent. And the biggest problem is that none of the rest of the story — especially the shallow presentation of his affairs, a related tragedy, and the much-reported sex scenes and nudity — are frankly remotely as interesting as the Los Alamos stuff. Every few scenes at Los Alamos, the story suddenly jumps to either the small room in which Oppenheimer is subjected to hours of questioning and character assassination, or a large Congressional chamber where we witness questions and answers during the confirmation process.How much time do you think you want to spend watching a detailed cinematic rendering of either of those things? Well, your answer better be, “Hours of both!” because that’s what Oppenheimer has in store for you.The sex and nudity is both grossly overstated in the media, and yet also totally unnecessary to the point those scenes not only add nothing to the film or our understanding of Oppenheimer — or the relationships, or the subtexts, literally nothing is served by the nudity or sex scenes. Indeed, during one scene of nudity and sex, the audience openly laughed at the unintentionally humorous absurdity of the moment.If you were to break up Oppenheimer into three distinct parts (as you easily could), each of the three — Los Alamos, the security clearance investigation, and the Congressional confirmation hearings — each feels like it could and perhaps should be its own film, or own chapter in a longer miniseries. And each storyline feels as if it were made by a different filmmaker with different ideas and intentions.If Oliver Stones’ filmJFKhad lacked a singular focused narrative point and perspective, if it focused mostly on exposition during meetings and instead of a sweeping narrative felt constrained and so grounded it seemed to be wearing lead shoes, if the more experimental moments were exaggerated even more, and if it was comprised of the most boring scenes and often the least relevant. And imagine if it has sex and nudity but as clinical, cold, and emotionless as possible, not to mention out of place and unnecessary to the point of distraction — the hero and his wife discussing the case except they’re naked, or having sex but they’re also in court.The film’s political sensibilities are also all over the map, seeming at times to represent one perspective only to shrug it off in favor of something else, yet all the while insisting to have no perspective at all really. It’s not even necessary the lack of particular position so much as the disinterested vacillating that’s really the problem.The end result is a film that wants us to sense its importance right from the start, and which constantly tries to remind us of its high-minded history and implications that include nothing less than an existential threat to human existence, but which feels like it says very little and means none of it. It’s a movie about Oppenheimer and several things that happened to him, some of it engrossing, some of it interesting enough for a magazine article, and much of it not worth paying to sit through three hours to experience.All of those complaints said, the performances are spectacular. Cillian Murphy absolutely deserves Oscar consideration, and Robert Downey Jr. is so masterful you can literally forget you're watching one of the most famous and recognizable stars of the modern era. Emily Blunt deserved far more chances to shine in the film, but when she finally gets the opportunity she delivers one of the film's most satisfying emotional moments (of which there are very few). Matt Damon has fun and provides welcome humor at times, while Florence Pugh does her utmost with a role too thinly written and uncompromising in its painfully accusatory portrayal.Any given scene might be good or even great, many extended sequences are wonderfully realized, and it almost always looks gorgeous. But Oppenheimer underwhelms, from its overall inability to tell a coherent story to its lack of reason for us to invest in any of these people’s personal stories. The atomic test, which should be one of the highlights at least visually and emotionally, is mostly just the trailer shots except longer, and as soon as the sequence ended I was perplexed and wondered, “Was that it?”Not that I just wanted a big CGI nuclear explosion — I understand what this film is meant to be and I know all of the arguments and points made about how and why war and destruction and armageddon shouldn’t be casually treated as entertainment, and why a would-be morality tale shouldn’t glamorize or glorify nuclear holocaust as an “achievement.” But the moment, including actual restored and enhanced footage, could and should easily convey the dread and large-scale impression of absolute extinction — and the reactions of Oppenheimer and others witnessing it — can add to these themes (the film includes a few nods in this direction post-test, just not as much as I expected). This is the central moment of Oppenheimer’s life, it’s why we speak his name today and why this movie exists and why his warning reverberate. So I just feel it should’ve been a more central moment in the film, instead of getting less screen time than and roughly equal emotional representation as his love life.I am a huge fan of Nolan’s work, regardless of whatever criticisms I’ve offered over the years. I fully expectedOppenheimerto blow me away and be one of my favorite films of the year. I imagined it would be on my top 10 list for 2023 and one of the primary contenders on my list of Best Picture nominees. Instead, I’m disappointed and would have a tough time sitting throughOppenheimeragain.Oppenheimeris Nolan’s weakest film to date, and a sharp contrast to his perfectly ambitious and complex vision inDunkirk.Still, if gettingDunkirk,Interstellar, andInceptionmeans we sometimes get flawed efforts likeOppenheimerthat might include glimpses of greatness, then I’m forever grateful he keeps reaching.Editorial StandardsReprints & PermissionsLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video© 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Christopher Nolan’s new film about it is absolutelyEnormoz, maybe his mostenormozso far: a gigantic, post-detonation study, a PTSD narrative procedure filling the giant screen with a million agonised fragments that are the shattered dreams and memories of the project’s haunted, complex driving force, J Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant physicist with the temperament of an artist who gave humanity the means of its own destruction.The main event is that terrifying first demonstration: the Trinity nuclear test in the New Mexico desert in July 1945, whenOppenheimeris said to have silently pondered (and later intoned on TV) Vishnu’s lines from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds …”This is the big bang, and no one could have made it bigger or more overwhelming than Nolan. He does this without simply turning it into an action stunt – although this movie, for all its audacity and ambition, never quite solves the problem of its own obtuseness: filling the drama at such length with the torment of genius-functionary Oppenheimer at the expense of showing the Japanese experience and the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Nolan moves back and forth in time, either side of the historic 1945 firebreak, giving us Oppenheimer’s beginnings as a young scientist, lonely and unhappy, electrified by the new developments in quantum mechanics, the young leftist who never became a Communist party member but whose anti-fascism galvanised his desire to develop the bomb before the Nazis could, directing the work of hundreds of scientists.Watch a trailer forOppenheimer.Later in the 50s, there is the disillusioned, compromised administrator, hounded by the McCarthyites for his communist connections, nauseated by his own pointless celebrity, by his failure to establish postwar international atomic control and by a single denied thought: the Nazis surrendered long before there was any suggestion they had the weapon, and bombing the defeated Japanese at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was merely to cow the Russians with a ruthless demonstration of the US’s nuclear mastery.Cillian Murphy is an eerily close lookalike for Oppenheimer with his trademark hat and pipe, and is very good at capturing his sense of solitude and emotional imprisonment, giving us the Oppenheimer million-yard stare, eyeballs set in a gaunt skull, seeing and foreseeing things he cannot process.Matt Damon is the boorish Lt Gen Leslie Groves, Oppenheimer’s exasperated military minder; Kenneth Branagh is his genial scientific hero and mentor Niels Bohr; Robert Downey Jr is the duplicitous Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss; Florence Pugh plays his lover Jean Tatlock, whose heart he broke, while Emily Blunt is his wife, Kitty, also badly treated. Tom Conti plays the sorrowfully detached Albert Einstein, and it has to be said that Nolan, rightly or wrongly, uses non-Jewish actors for Oppenheimer and Einstein, two of the most famous Jewish people in history and in fact doesn’t quite get to grips with the antisemitism that Oppenheimer faced as an assimilated secular American Jew.View image in fullscreenAfter the first test, Oppenheimer is reported to have said ‘Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds’.Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal PicturesThere is a horribly gripping scene showing Oppenheimer’s formative experience as an unhappy graduate student in England at Christ’s College, Cambridge. He suffered what amounted to a psychotic breakdown and left a poisoned apple on the desk of his testy supervisor Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy), which Blackett fortunately didn’t notice and didn’t eat. Nolan coolly invites to see this as a parable for the lost Eden of a more innocent prewar physics, with Oppenheimer as a serpent with Adam’s foolish innocence. And of course there is the creeping biographical irony: how terribly close Oppenheimer came to … killing someone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the successful detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, Murphy shows us Oppenheimer in shock, but also realising he has to address an audience of cheering colleagues and subordinates. He knows it is his duty as a leader to congratulate them and be upbeat, stammering out some fatuous remark about how the Japanese “didn’t like it”, then realising how callous that was, and beginning to hallucinate the horror. Of course, Oppenheimer did not witness the actual use of his weapon, he never saw anything becoming death, the destroyer of worlds, and Nolan takes the decision to look away from it too, to stay in the US, to stay with Oppenheimer himself in all his sudden tragic irrelevance.Perhaps the film’s most important moment is the one that addresses its own flaw: the legendary postwar encounter in the White House Oval Office between Oppenheimer and President Harry S Truman (played by Gary Oldman), the man who took the final executive decision to drop the bomb. Nolan and Murphy show how Oppenheimer shrinks and cringes into the couch in front of him, like a scared little boy, apparently wanting something like absolution from the president and mumbling that he feels he has “blood on his hands”. Angry and baffled, Truman tells him curtly that all this is his responsibility as president and asks a very pertinent question: does Oppenheimer think the Japanese care who made the bomb? No, they want to know who dropped it. It’s true: concentrating on Oppenheimer is simultaneously fascinating and beside the larger historical point.In the end, Nolan shows us how the US’s governing class couldn’t forgive Oppenheimer for making them lords of the universe, couldn’t tolerate being in the debt of this liberal intellectual. Oppenheimer is poignantly lost in the kaleidoscopic mass of broken glimpses: the sacrificial hero-fetish of the American century.Oppenheimer is released on 20 July in Australia, and 21 July in the US and UK.This article was amended on 20 July 2023 to give Lt Gen Leslie Groves his more commonly used name.

Smaller bangs — the big one would come much later, in the New Mexico desert. But forJ. Robert Oppenheimer, the quantum physicist who would guide the greatest scientific minds of his generation towardcreating a doomsday device, it was all just a constant collision and coming apart of matter in his head. Put the man in a lab, and he’s hopeless. Let him roam in the world of theories, and Oppenheimer could hear what a mentor dubbed “the music of science.” Those symphonies gave him visions of black holes, collapsing stars, developing nebulae, gaseous eruptions, particles moving at the speed of light, molecules spinning, atoms splitting. He sees these things, and thenwesee these things, rendered in 70mm IMAX. Any filmmaker can create a cinematic universe. (Many have. Too many, some might say.) Very few can show you how a genius perceives the building blocks ofouruniverse, right before that same person imagines something that threatens our existence in it.This is whatChristopher Nolandoes inOppenheimer,a biopic on the “father of the atomic bomb,” and in terms of getting you into the mindset of its subject, these bursts of abstract imagery are a brilliant move on his part. It’s not the only ace the writer-director has up his well-tailored sleeve, mind you — there are somewhere between four to five timelines bumping against each other at any given moment, it’s shot in both saturated color and stark black & white, itssound designequally prizes dead silence and deafening booms, and the cast is comprised of seemingly every third actor with a SAG card. Not to mention a depth-charge performance byCillian Murphyas the Man Who Would Be Destroyer of Worlds, one that allows the tiniest surface ripples to communicate the agony and the ecstasy of changing the world.But those interspersed shots of cosmic debris and microscopic detonations, some of which abruptly interrupt exchanges and others that smoothly transition viewers from one scene to the next, are perfect examples of how to let you experience someone like Oppenheimer’s perspective byshowing,rather than telling. And it sometimes feels like those two camps — the cinematic and the chatty-to-a-fault — are fighting it out on Nolan’s massive canvas in a way that resembles nuclear fission minus the energy release.Editor’s picksThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So FarThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All TimeThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time100 Best Movies of the 21st CenturyTaking its cues from the exhaustive, Pulitzer-winning bookAmerican Prometheusby Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin,Oppenheimerseeks to cram as much of the man’s life, his work, his elevation to national hero, his eventual persecution, and his personal demons into three hours. Just for good measure, Nolan throws in not one but two competing courtroom dramas as well. There’s a roll-the-dice sensation throughout: Scenes of people sitting in rooms talking can seem thrilling or plodding, clarify historical conflicts and complicated concepts or confuse the hell out of you. Set pieces feel sweeping one second, and like they’re sucking the oxygen out of the room the next. Then, suddenly, the movie cuts to a huge close-up of Murphy, his eyes suggesting a man wrestling for his soul, and you’re transfixed. As with so much of Nolan’s work, you can feel a truly great film peeking out in fits and spurts within a longer, slightly uneven one.It’s a tough thing to admit, given that Nolan is one of Hollywood’s few name-above-the-title auteurs left standing. He can still get an original mega-budgeted film greenlit, and has taken on the mantle of keeping alive not just film as a medium but film as a physical means of storytelling. His work is intellectual yet visceral, philosophical yet pulse-pounding; he’s always managed to smuggle big ideas into multiplexes via blockbuster templates, even in genres he hasn’t completelyterraformed. Like its better half in the joint entity now known as “Barbenheimer,”Oppenheimerisn’t afraid to talk up to an audience (althoughinBarbie‘s case, the degree of difficulty in doing that via a decades-old brand of dolls feels damn near revolutionary). And along with that shiny happy toy story, Nolan’s biography of a key figure of the 20th century has been burdened with the responsibility of saving motion pictures from financial instability and existential free fall. Heavy are the heads that wear the crown, etc.Related ContentRyan Reynolds Teases Deadpool Appearance in Upcoming ‘Avengers’ Film‘Weapons’ Takes Aim at Your Nervous System — and FiresWatch Matt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel Reignite Their Feud on ‘Millionaire’'Happy Gilmore 2': Hooray! Adam Sandler's Brawling Golf Bro Is BackSo let us now praise movies about famous men, and the famous men who make them.Oppenheimeris most assuredly a Christopher Nolan film, complete with the blessings and the curses of what that phrase entails. The good stuff first: There are a handful of sequences that remind you why this 52-year-old director is considered a godhead by film geeks, genre freaks, and armchair arthouse-cinema scholars alike. When Nolan is on, he ison, as evidenced by the early scenes of Oppenheimer and his military liaison, General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon, all mustache and bluster), assembling the eggheads. Their plan is to turn the small New Mexico burg of Los Alamos into a self-sufficient, family-friendly town for a group of scientists and a top-secret think tank for a weapon of mass destruction. The military need the end result ofthe Manhattan Projectto win WWII, preferably before the Germans develop their own version of “the gadget.” Oppenheimer, both compelled by and wary of the opportunity, wants them to maintain the “moral advantage” after the world sees what this thing can do.Concentrating on the mounting pressure to deliver, the miniature steps forward with each behind-the-scenes breakthrough, and the accountability factor causing friction between the project leader and his patrons,Oppenheimerbecomes its own ticking time bomb. All the while, fractures are happening within the team, and the precariousness of the situation, along with Oppenheimer’s willingness to go through with opening this Pandora’s Box, brings things to a tipping point. These scenes remind you of how Nolan understands the use of sound and vision as a means of emotional engagement (helped in no small part by his regular cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and composerLudwig Göransson‘s score); how his ability to fold complex ideas into presentations of human behavior, and vice versa, comes through in his writing; how the timing of a cut and the framing of an image can transform a moment from grandiose or mundane to sublime. The gent is a genuine filmmaker. He’s a big-screen artist, the bigger the screens the better.And these sequences, in particular, reinforce the notion of Nolan as a great director of actors, even if the performances overall are across the board in terms of screen time and effectiveness. Not just Murphy, who’s worked withThe Dark Knightdirector before and delivers an Oppenheimer that goes far beyond the there-goeth-the-great-man clichés associated with many biopics. There’s Damon, whose repartee with Murphy approaches screwball levels. There’sRobert Downey Jr.as Lewis Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission who turns a perceived slight into a postwar vendetta against Oppenheimer. (It’s not an exaggeration to say that Downey does some of the best work of his long career here.) There’s Gary Oldman as President Harry S. Truman, who turns a single scene in the Oval Office into a damning portrait of the POTUS as a complete bastard.There’sFlorence Pugh, andEmily Blunt, andBenny Safdie, Josh Hartnett,Rami Malek,Kenneth Branagh,Casey Affleck, Jason Clarke, Matthew Modine, Olivia Thirlby, Dane DeHaan,Alden Ehrenreich… it’s actually quicker to list who’snotinOppenheimer.Nolan has said he wanted to cast recognizable faces so that audiences could keep track of who’s who easier, but he also gives them opportunities to flex, whether it’s for a minute or the majority of the running time. And given that there are so many scenes of people conversing, reading, lecturing, interrogating, handwringing and musing over the morality of mass destruction, they have to keep things afloat as much as their ringmaster.Cillian MurphyinOppenheimerUniversal PicturesOppenheimerpeaks with the Trinity test, a roughly 10-minute sequence that follows the lead-up to the detonation of the first atomic bomb, its blast, and the sense of shock and awe that greets this game-changing “gadget.” Soon after, we see Oppenheimer addressing his fellow scientists about their victory, and he’s greeted with visions of blinding lights, burnt corpses, and empty bleachers. It’s a climactic gut punch… and there’s still another hour or so to go. Which leads us to the less-than-stellar aspects of Nolan’s A-list A-bomb-creator’s origin story. Threaded in between the race against time to craft this killing machine prototype are recreations of a 1954 tribunal over renewing Oppenheimer’s security clearance, in light of the Soviets now having their own nuclear weapons, and a 1959 congressional hearing on Strauss’s bid to join President Eisenhower’s cabinet. It’s here that we get flashback glimpses of the physicist’s career before Los Alamos, his tenure at UC Berkeley, his marriage to Blunt’s Kitty Oppenheimer, his attempt to reconcile what he’s unleashed on the world and what turns out to be a contentious relationship with Strauss.Trending StoriesAll the ‘Saturday Night Live’ Cast and Writers Leaving Ahead of Season 51Sabrina Carpenter's Album 'Man's Best Friend' Is Finally HereHayley Williams Powers Through Grief to Deliver a Solo MasterpieceHeidi Gardner Is Leaving 'Saturday Night Live' After 8 YearsIt’s also where the movie starts to waver in terms of storytelling, cutting back and forth to create a tapestry of the 20th century that’s meant to enrich the scenes of science being used and abused in the name of warfare (Nolan’s politics are a moving target in this film, as they are in much of his work, though it’s safe to say he’s solidly anti-nukes here). They end up drawing both the focus and the momentum away from the movie, even if they do flesh some aspects out and give Downey a primo showcase. You suddenly become more aware of Nolan’s tendency to favor giant compositions and conceptual overreaches over connecting narrative dots in certain places, which has been a longstanding criticism. There are some questionable bits of business that play out as well. It’s one thing to let Pugh’s Jean Tatlock, whose Communist affiliation would still haunt J. Robert decades after their torrid affair ended, to be the one who hands him the Sanskrit poem that would be his response to Trinity: “Now I am become Death, destroyer of worlds.” It’s another to have her do it while she’s writing topless on top of him, which is… a choice. And the less said about her and Murphy getting hot and heavy during an interrogation-session hallucination, the better — we can now say that sex scenes arenotNolan’s forte.As those two trials intertwine and paint a picture of Oppenheimer as both McCarthy-era martyr and, ultimately, the victor over Strauss’s smear campaign during the movie’s last act, there’s a slight sensation of listening to wind blowing through torn sails. In attempting to get a 360-degree picture of his subject’s life and times on as big a scale as possible, it feels as if Nolan occasionally loses sight of the big picture as a whole.Oppenheimeris one of those shoot-for-the-moon projects that feels thrilling and wonky, brilliant and overstuffed, too much and yet not enough. It’s also a movie that brings to mind the difficult era-spanning epics of yesteryear, fromRedstoThe Right Stuff,and is a movie made by adults for adults yet done with the sweep and majesty we now associate with movies made for kids and teens. Nolan has made what can sometimes feel like a maddeningly elusive attempt to make a grand statement about then and now, only to continually drown himself out in the technical equivalent of theZimmer Honk. He’s also given us one of the only movies of the summer that you reallyhaveto see.In this article:Alden Ehrenreich,Benny Safdie,Casey Affleck,Christopher Nolan,Cillian Murphy,Emily Blunt,Florence Pugh,J.

notice, but it's just absolutely wild that post production thought it was a good idea to have floating particles cover up the beautiful scape of Los Alamos\", \"Florence Pugh's character was very shallow and was used uncreatively as an narrative tool:Yes, we're used to this with many Nolan films, shallow characters used to drive the main characters motivations in an obvious way\", \"Maybe there was potential to have him fit in another way, but there's something about his acting and presence that is super unconvincing and unfitting\", \"This is likely just a bias that I cannot explain

portraying psychological distress', 'It was very creative and arguably innovative', \"The hooks in the movie had incredible pacing in synchronicity to Ludwig's score AND ironically great exposition:In

NothingZachary ZanattaJul ,  min readIn the slate of releases scheduled for ,Oppenheimerwas more than a big deal', 'I have never been a big Nolan fan', 'So understandably, upon hearing Christopher Nolan would be writing and directing a historical biopic about a topic as dark and complex as the creation of the atomic bomb, I didn’t get my hopes up', 'But as the release date grew closer, I found my excitement growing', 'Nolan continues to hone his technical abilities, and the results speak for themselves', 'His eye for spectacle is one of the strongest in Hollywood and his dedication to his craft is beyond admirable', 'His commitment to detail and dryness renders spectacle as something sublime', 'So as an experience, it’s a fascinating exercise', 'The thumping score that meshes with the crisp sound all scoring some of the most striking imagery of the year, if there’s anything I can giveOppenheimer,it is most certainly an audiovisual triumph', 'Be that as it may, technical prowess alone cannot carry a film, and outside of impressive cinematic mastery,Oppenheimerfalls apart', 'Nolan invites the audience to explore a complex character, but there’s nothing under the surface that warrants said exploration', 'As a character, Oppenheimer is simply a greatest hits compilation of the real scientist', 'Nolan’s writing neglects meaningful character exploration', 'The true story of Oppenheimer is one that demands respect and heft, but Nolan’s adherence to this drab atmosphere becomes exhausting', 'Multiple scenes are borderline comical yet are treated with utmost sincerity', 'While believing in your story is vital, it seems like Nolan insists upon himself', 'Moments like Albert Einstein emerging from the dark to dispense advice like Nick Fury in Iron Man are laughable, butOppenheimeris a film that cannot see past itself', 'Oppenheimeris a film far too busy to do justice to any of its themes, let alone one like the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki', 'In films likeThe Dark Knight,it swiftly cuts through exposition so we can quicker experience massive action set pieces', 'Each idea is just  others in a trench coat, with none ever amounting to anything substantial', 'Everything simply happens because it must, not leaving space for the film to come to any conclusions or meaningful commentary', 'For an action film, that’s fine, but for a film as heavy asOppenheimer,that won’t fly', 'Themes are made to fit with each other, not to develop meaningfully beyond the film', 'One could argue, yes', 'It’s not a method of learning or understanding through an artistic lens, it’s a presentation of a real tragedy that favors being economic over being meaningful', 'As an independent artistic experience,Oppenheimerdoesn’t offer anything unique or meaningful on the subject', 'WhileOppenheimerseems to be a hit among critics and audiences alike, I myself am not caught up in the rapturous reception', 'To me,Oppenheimeris everything a modern blockbuster shouldn’t be', 'A big cast, IMAX, a legendary director, technical proficiency, and a larger-than-life subject does not make a masterpiece', 'It loudly exclaims meaning, demanding that it be deemed a masterpiece, but under the noise there is a deafening silence', 'Christopher Nolan seems to have it in his head thatOppenheimerwas always destined to be his opus, and as a result didn’t bother to clean up or refine his style', 'The story of the atomic bomb is one that deserves attention, a historical landmark at the crossroads of science of morality', 'PS: If you’re looking for films about the devastating effects of the atomic bombing on Japan, I recommendGrave of the FirefliesandHiroshima Mon Amour,two brilliant films that tackle the idea with complexities and nuance that I didn’t see reflected inOppenheimer', 'Shaun HensonImage courtesy of Universal\"Robert Oppenheimer was an enigma,” Kai Bird and Martin J', 'Sherwin tell us inAmerican Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J', '” He was “a symbol,” fellow physicist Hideki Yukawa, Japan’s first Nobel Prize winner said, of the “tragedy of the modern nuclear scientist', 'It is instead a beautiful virtuosic piece of dramatic cinema capturing all of this and more about the man, his work, his professional and personal relationships, and his legacy, and with all the seriousness and characteristic flare of a Nolan film project that should appeal to virtually any viewer regardless of interests', 'I, being scientifically minded since early childhood and especially regarding physics, found the film positively riveting – all  hours of it', 'I recommend it heartily, like many other reviewers giving it universal acclaim, and for a variety of reasons, most of them surely relevant to us all', 'That aside, even the semi-regular filmgoerwillknow most of Nolan’s works as producer, director, or both, such a popular impact have they had', 'His best known projects to date includeMemento(),Insomnia(),Batman Begins(),The Prestige(),The Dark Knight()—for which Heath Ledger won a well-deserved posthumous Oscar portraying Batman’s nemesis the Joker—Inception(),The Dark Knight Rises(),Interstellar(),Dunkirk(),Tenet(), and nowOppenheimer()', '),Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice(),Justice League(), andZach Snyder’s Justice League(), his connection to these latter projects as producer or executive producer barely recognized', 'Nolan has even invented equipment, should he envision a new way of doing something, of wresting from the creative processes something that he wants to make happen', 'ForOppenheimer, continuing this pioneering trend, Nolan had Kodak create a new and special type of black and white film to fit his preferred mm IMAX format', 'Throughout the course of the story, his direction dances between black and white and colour segments to help us follow the storylines from various points of view', 'The effect is so striking, the black and white so immaculate in Nolan’s format, that others will again want to use this technology so effective in the telling ofOppenheimer', 'And what storytelling it is, and with what notable acting talent to help Nolan tell it', 'Some have called the film a work of horror so replete is this aspect throughout it, and so vividly portrayed', 'Feynman temporarily stopped his Princeton PhD in physics to help with the so-called Manhattan Project based at the secret laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico (–), where he was the youngest group leader in the theoretical division', 'Feynman agreed to join because he realised that if Americans were attempting to produce such a dreadful weapon, others like the Nazis must be trying to do the same; and they were', 'Decades later, on an episode of the BBC’sHorizonprogramme dedicated to the by then famous Feynman, which I have also watched for this review (‘The Pleasure of Finding Things Out’,  November ), he admitted that the achievement of the bomb pushed him into a dark depression such that he balked even at seeing simple construction projects like bridges being built around his hometown, New York City', 'There is a fleeting humorous moment offsetting the otherwise unceasingly intense film as the characters consider this unthinkable possible scenario', \"Murphy’s Oppenheimer admits to Matt Damon’s General Leslie Groves, who was ultimately in charge of the military project, the prospect:Leslie Groves: “Are you saying that there's a chance that when we push that button\", 'Robert Oppenheimer: “The chances are near zero', '”Leslie Groves: “Zerowould be nice', '”In truth, Oppenheimer’s reassuring ‘near zero’ was a stretch of faith, as some physicists on the Los Alamos site were actively taking bets over whether this would actually happen', 'Flanking the instantly recognizable Murphy and Damon playing Oppenheimer and Groves, the cast of characters played by quite a long list of additionally familiar actors reads like a who’s who of the quantum physics revolution', 'Granted, perhaps one does have to be a physics geek like me to find the -minute extravaganza as exciting as I did', 'Other actors portraying key people in the nucleus of Oppenheimer’s personal life include Emily Blunt as his equally brilliant wife Kitty, and Oxford’s own Florence Pugh—whose father owns several restaurants in town—playing Oppenheimer’s suicidal lover, Jean Tatlock', 'I have no question but that some of these people will be nominated for awards following this film, and really should win them', 'Credit: Universal PicturesI have noted why I saw the film – I teach and publish on areas like quantum mechanics in the light of philosophy and religion, and simply love the subject area, which is as much pleasure as work to me', 'The Federation of American Scientists records that more than  percent of the totality of nuclear weapons is owned by only two countries, the United States and Russia', 'The remainder are

or process of splitting the nucleus of an atom to release a large amount of energy) is today also a useful source of energy, and nuclear fusion (the act or process of combining the nuclei of atoms to form a heavier nucleus to release a large amount of energy) shows promise, if made viable, of being the greatest energy revolution ever conceived', 'Following these reasons, the film can have important implications for theology, philosophy, and religion broadly', '‘And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white’ (Matthew ', 'And broader religious studies questions are brought to bear by Oppenheimer’s personal fascination with Hinduism', 'He considered ‘The Lord’s Song’ from the ancient text ‘the most beautiful philosophical song existing in any known tongue’, and gave copies of the Gita as gifts to friends', 'The central theme is arguably the life-long horror that men like Oppenheimer, and his friend Feynman, felt upon realising what they had done', 'While I won’t ruin it for you, the ending of the film is haunting and affecting along these lines', 'It is doubtless a mature display of great artistic and technical skill', 'For a Nolan masterpiece comparable toOppenheimerseeInterstellarif you have not yet', 'Also, do read the book by Bird and Sherwin on which it is heavily based – and all  pages of that as I did

this might be some of the best work, I have seen from him in a while, and you hold on to his every word', 'Matt Damon plays Leslie Groves who comes in to try and keep this project from flying off the rails and has a mostly calming effect on the film', 'In recent films, Christopher Nolan has always liked to play with the notion of time, and I wondered how he would explore that in what is a straightforward narrative compared to films likeInterstellar', 'This led to some interesting choices, like having future events from the film’s perspective be in black-and-white when you usually would reserve that for sections set in the past', 'But this helps frame the movie from Robert’s perspective and create a visual language to help support the narrative', 'Oppenheimer uses visual language to help support the written narrative', 'Which leads us to the visual presentation and what a visually stunning film this is', 'It has very stylised depictions of all the nuclear processes, but you get absorbed into this world where flames become part of the visual language of the film', 'This is supported by what I think might be my favourite musical score that Ludwig Göransson has made', 'Yes, that story about Kyoto actually happened', 'However, when it came to discussing ethics around nuclear weapons, it felt like the film didn’t go far enough to engage with what happened to the people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki', 'I know this will be a more personal note here, but having experienced the deeply emotional Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, I could not help but feel there were missed opportunities', '” I will also say the last  minutes were something I loved about the film, but given how long the movie is, I think this shift will be a hard sell for many', 'That does not take away

good enough word of mouth to drive strong business and break into other demographics besides primarily middle-aged white men', 'If reviews are bad, it needs overwhelmingly great word of mouth to do

care about buzz and reviews, who will show up at theaters this weekend and ask themselves, “What will I see', 'Hmm, which one is supposed to be good', 'Luckily for Nolan and Universal Pictures, so far reviews are highly positive', 'The Cinemascore will tell us how audiences feel, and the combo of the two should paint a fairly clear picture at least for the short term', 'A B+ grade will suggest weak support in its most enthusiastic viewers — opening weekend fans and those who show up because they were inspired by the buzz and marketing — and thus I’d expect a disappointing overall showing for the film at the end of its box office run', 'An A or A+ is what everyone involved in the picture most wants to hear, and would suggest a run similar perhaps to Nolan’s previous pictureDunkirk, another historic true story that earned widespread acclaim and is the filmmaker’s greatest achievement to date', 'ForbesCritic Identifies The Secret Ingredients That Make Screenwriters Better Than A', 'Oppenheimeris ambitious and includes many mesmerizing, often brilliant moments, but those moments cannot sustain themselves nor find common ground as a single compelling narrative or perspective', 'Despite seemingly global and even cosmic themes, it winds up feeling decidedly contained and restricted, eyes cast downward, abandoning any visionary search for higher meaning behind the processes of science or politics', 'And in certain moments — far too few and largely restricted to brief early scenes , as it turns out — the film takes on an expressionist, surrealist quality when giving us early glimpses into Oppenheimer’s fascination with quantum theory and its implications', \"Forbes'Mission: Impossible' Sequel Tops $+ Million Worldwide Today At Box OfficeByMark HughesHowever, while it’s technically true that the film contains and returns constantly to a generally clinical presentation of scientific highlight moments during the creation of secretive Los Alamos, the main stories are not the bomb\", '”It feels like a series of “this happened, and then this happened,” scenes collecting events from his life to form some sort of collage, with the parts then mixed into random orders and competing stories, all represented in different ways — more modern moments are black and white, older events in traditional “dramatic period piece” style, and mid-era events a starker almost sizzling representation of s or s newsreel', 'I can appreciate using different approaches to distinguish different eras and/or to try to fit the feel of those particular times, but it feels like either the decisions were made at random or — and I’m not sure if this would be better or worse, depending on how much you do or don’t agree with any of the film’s various competing perspectives — to intentionally present Strauss’ storyline in absolute black-and-white terms, present the hearings against Oppenheimer as conspiratorial and too literally glaring in their hypocrisy, and to present the Los Alamos backstory in a gentler, reverent manner', \"ForbesFilm Critic's Picks: Top  Best Movies About Unions And Labor StrikesByMark HughesHard to say, because if not then he merely adapted a biography and attempted to include too many threads that each might’ve held its own appeal but which don’t fit together well in the form he’s created here, which would be a failure of adaptation\", 'How much time do you think you want to spend watching a detailed cinematic rendering of either of those things', 'Well, your answer better be, “Hours of both', 'Indeed, during one scene of nudity and sex, the audience openly laughed at the unintentionally humorous absurdity of the moment', 'If you were to break up Oppenheimer into three distinct parts (as you easily could), each of the three — Los Alamos, the security clearance investigation, and the Congressional confirmation hearings — each feels like it could and perhaps should be its own film, or own chapter in a longer miniseries', 'The film’s political sensibilities are also all over the map, seeming at times to represent one perspective only to shrug it off in favor of something else, yet all the while insisting to have no perspective at all really', 'The end result is a film that wants us to sense its importance right from the start, and which constantly tries to remind us of its high-minded history and implications that include nothing less than an existential threat to human existence, but which feels like it says very little and means none of it', 'It’s a movie about Oppenheimer and several things that happened to him, some of it engrossing, some of it interesting enough for a magazine article, and much of it not worth paying to sit through three hours to experience', \"is so masterful you can literally forget you're watching one of the most famous and recognizable stars of the modern era\", \"Emily Blunt deserved far more chances to shine in the film, but when she finally gets the opportunity she delivers one of the film's most satisfying emotional moments (of which there are very few)\", 'Matt Damon has fun and provides welcome humor at times, while Florence Pugh does her utmost with a role too thinly written and uncompromising in its painfully accusatory portrayal', 'Any given scene might be good or even great, many extended sequences are wonderfully realized, and it almost always looks gorgeous', 'So I just feel it should’ve been a more central moment in the film, instead of getting less screen time than and roughly equal emotional representation as his love life', 'I am a huge fan of Nolan’s work, regardless of whatever criticisms I’ve offered over the years', 'I fully expectedOppenheimerto blow me away and be one of my favorite films of the year', 'I imagined it would be on my top  list for  and one of the primary contenders on my list of Best Picture nominees', 'Oppenheimeris Nolan’s weakest film to date, and a sharp contrast to his perfectly ambitious and complex vision inDunkirk', 'Still, if gettingDunkirk,Interstellar, andInceptionmeans we sometimes get flawed efforts likeOppenheimerthat might include glimpses of greatness, then I’m forever grateful he keeps reaching', 'Cillian Murphy is an eerily close lookalike for Oppenheimer with his trademark hat and pipe, and is very good at capturing his sense of solitude and emotional imprisonment, giving us the Oppenheimer million-yard stare, eyeballs set in a gaunt skull, seeing and foreseeing things he cannot process', 'We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the

cheering colleagues and subordinates', 'He knows it is his duty as a leader to congratulate them and be upbeat, stammering out some fatuous remark about how the Japanese “didn’t like it”, then realising how callous that was, and beginning to hallucinate the horror', 'Nolan and Murphy show how Oppenheimer shrinks and cringes into the couch in front of him, like a scared little boy, apparently wanting something like absolution from the president and mumbling that he feels he has “blood on his hands”', 'It’s true: concentrating on Oppenheimer is simultaneously fascinating and

peeking out in fits and spurts within a longer, slightly uneven one', 'He can still get an original mega-budgeted film greenlit, and has taken on the mantle of keeping alive not just film as a medium but film as a physical means of storytelling', 'His work is intellectual yet visceral, philosophical yet pulse-pounding; he’s always managed to smuggle big ideas into multiplexes via blockbuster templates, even in genres he hasn’t completelyterraformed', 'And along with that shiny happy toy story, Nolan’s biography of a key figure of the th century has been burdened with the responsibility of saving motion pictures from financial instability and existential free fall', \"Adam Sandler's Brawling Golf Bro Is BackSo let us now praise movies about famous men, and the famous men who make

remind you why this -year-old director is considered a godhead by film geeks, genre freaks, and armchair arthouse-cinema scholars alike', 'Their plan is to turn the small New Mexico burg of Los Alamos into a self-sufficient, family-friendly town for a group of scientists and a top-secret think tank for a weapon of mass destruction', 'The military need the end result ofthe Manhattan Projectto win WWII, preferably before the Germans develop their own version of “the gadget', '” Oppenheimer, both compelled by and wary of the opportunity, wants them to maintain the “moral advantage” after the world sees what this thing can do', 'Concentrating on the mounting pressure to deliver, the miniature steps forward with each behind-the-scenes breakthrough, and the accountability factor causing friction between the project leader and his patrons,Oppenheimerbecomes its own ticking time bomb', 'All the while, fractures are happening within the team, and the precariousness of the situation, along with Oppenheimer’s willingness to go through with opening this Pandora’s Box, brings things to a tipping point', 'These scenes remind you of how Nolan understands the use of sound and vision as a means of emotional engagement (helped in no small part by his regular cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and composerLudwig Göransson‘s score); how his ability to fold complex ideas into presentations of human behavior, and vice versa, comes through in his writing; how the timing of a cut and the framing of an image can transform a moment from grandiose or mundane to sublime', 'He’s a big-screen artist, the bigger the screens the better', 'And these sequences, in particular, reinforce the notion of Nolan as a great director of actors, even if the performances overall are across the board in terms of screen time and effectiveness', 'Not just Murphy, who’s worked withThe Dark Knightdirector before and delivers an Oppenheimer that goes far beyond the there-goeth-the-great-man clichés associated with many biopics', '(It’s not an exaggeration to say that Downey does some of the best work of his long career here', 'Nolan has said he wanted to cast recognizable faces so that audiences could keep track of who’s who easier, but he also gives them opportunities to flex, whether it’s for a minute or the majority of the running time', 'Cillian MurphyinOppenheimerUniversal PicturesOppenheimerpeaks with the Trinity test, a roughly -minute sequence that follows the lead-up to the detonation of the first atomic bomb, its blast, and the sense of shock and awe that greets this game-changing “gadget', '” Soon after, we see Oppenheimer addressing his fellow scientists about their victory, and he’s greeted with visions of blinding lights, burnt corpses, and empty bleachers', 'You suddenly become more aware of Nolan’s tendency to favor giant compositions and conceptual overreaches over connecting narrative dots in certain places, which has been a longstanding criticism', '” It’s another to have her do it while she’s writing topless on top of him, which is… a choice', 'And the less said about her and Murphy getting hot and heavy during an interrogation-session hallucination, the better — we can now say that sex scenes arenotNolan’s forte', 'In attempting to get a -degree picture of his subject’s life and times on as big a scale as possible, it feels as if Nolan occasionally loses sight of the big picture as a whole', 'Oppenheimeris one of those shoot-for-the-moon projects that feels thrilling and wonky, brilliant and

also feel the immense fragility of humanity due to our potential for barbarism, conspiracy and self-destruction at the level of the atomic bomb, while also feeling awe for our ingenuity, intelligence and glamour in our scientific, political and artistic pursuits in life', 'The film is made all the more potent once you realize all of this, developing and using atomic bomb, and for the most part, happened, and this is who we are, and you are viewing, to some extent, reality, when you watch the bomb explode and observe the human circumstances arround it', \"In a bad or mediocre movie, you wish you weren't at the theater\", '\"Oppenheimer\" Review: An Atomic Blast of Nothingtop of pageCinemastersNever Stop Watching', 'Nolan makes films of immense action centered around the figure of the lonely, shattered man, and the father of the atomic bomb was the perfect figure to serve as the apex of Nolan’s filmography', 'Along with that was Nolan’s cutting ties with Warner Brothers due to the theatrical mishandling of his last film, Tenet, which saw a simultaneous theatrical and streaming release', 'Nolan’s displeasure at Tenet’s release resulted in Universal buildingOppenheimer’s release around the theatre experience with emphasis on the mm and IMAX experience', 'I was ready for Nolan to grow past his character writing flaws and develop a film that truly defines his career as more than just an action filmmaker', 'And after  hours, to say I was disappointed would be an understatement', 'While I believeOppenheimerto be a hollow and messy experience, it does have its merits', 'It pitches so hard into realism it becomes almost abstract within the landscape of cinema', 'It provides a rhythmic almost musical experience where destruction is rendered as an elemental dance', 'One ofOppenheimer’s worst offenses is the worst part of any Nolan film, the character writing, particularly concerning the titular scientist', 'His life is defined by moral conflicts concerning war, science, politics, love, and family,Oppenheimeris a mosaic of struggle', 'Nolan opts to portray these struggles as intentionally vague, but the effect is alienating rather than intriguing', 'Each relationship, scientific achievement, decision, and struggle is explored with painstaking detail', 'The reasoning behind any of his personal conflicts is nowhere to be found', 'Nolan takes the building blocks presented by Oppenheimer’s life but doesn’t draw a story from them', 'Nolan’s protagonists exist in a world, they don’t live in it, Oppenheimer is no different', 'Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer reacts to the volatile world with a thousand-yard stare, yet there’s no identity behind those eyes', 'As a biopic, it teaches the audience all about the wondrous science behind the destruction, but the complex emotion behind it is simply telegraphed without ever materializing', 'With a story as dense as that of the atomic bomb, Nolan’s typical “silent man with a problem” ends up collapsing any meaning behind the film', 'He expects the audience to be moved through events alone, without ever needing to develop a character, and for a film likeOppenheimer,that does not suffice', 'However,Oppenheimer’s biggest flaw lies in its very subject matter', 'Much of my trepidation going intoOppenheimerwas a result of Christopher Nolan dissecting a topic as devastating and terrifying as the use of the atomic bomb in the Second World War', 'Its hollowness is buried in its busyness, masquerading pointless noise as profundity', 'Politics, family, friends, religion, patriotism, sex, evil, war, all of these define the film, but nothing defines these themes', 'The evil of Hiroshima is something once again commodified in Nolan’s thematic structure', 'It’s framed through a lens of Oppenheimer’s personal struggles with his hand in its creation, but also with the rest of his struggles', 'Nolan’s thematic stitching attempts to complicate the conflict of the bombings, but it completely undermines it', 'The death of millions is added to a file folder of “Oppenheimer’s problems” and it sits alongside issues like “nagging wife” and “being too smart”', 'To add dimension to this conflict by way of personal experience is compelling, but to Nolan, dimension is added by convoluting the subject', 'The tragedy of Hiroshima is contorted to fit into Nolan’s intellectual puzzle that strips it of dramatic heft and shaves off the difficult to swallow edges', 'My knowledge of the Manhattan project increased, and my fear of nuclear destruction was rekindled, but the man behind the camera had nothing to do with that', 'Oppenheimeris a film that, for me, is propped up on toothpicks, but the minute I delve into it, it collapses', 'The book is the account of Oppenheimer’s life and works on which Christopher Nolan’s latest film,Oppenheimer, a biopic of the physicist who gave us the terror of the atomic bomb, is based', 'Murphy captures the attested complexities of the man well, including his tortured pathos as relayed in Bird and Sherwin’s book and by numerous personal reports', 'Such pathos was embedded in Oppenheimer’s complicated psyche long before he helped to create the bomb and realised what terrible powers of destruction he had helped to accomplish and unleash', 'When Murphy utters Oppenheimer’s famous quotation from Vishnu in the Bhagavad-Gita, ‘Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,’ we sense the scientist’s bizarre mix of elation and shock at the achievement, seeing it on the actor’s gaunt and haunted face', 'Murphy reportedly starved himself, routinely avoiding meals with his fellow actors on the set to become the pained Oppenheimer incarnate', 'Oppenheimer was always by common account a quite tortured soul, and this grew to palpable levels following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki', 'He felt, and in many ways literally was, personally responsible for making such destruction possible, which he quickly realised could literally end the world entirely, should people act irresponsibly with the then newfound fire from the gods', '“I remember thinking that things were … sort of doomed, because already it appeared to me, earlier than to others who were more optimistic, that international relations and the way people were behaving was no different than it had ever been before', 'And I was sure it [the atomic bomb] was therefore going to be used very soon … and I thought, really believed, that it was senseless to makeanythingbecause it would all be destroyed very soon anyway', '”As the film depicts, it was in fact not actually known with certainty whether the explosion of even a single nuclear weapon at the level of clandestine development and testing might set off a nuclear chain reaction that could keep going and destroy the planet', 'we destroy the world', 'Robert Oppenheimer: “What do you want from theory alone', \"Yet there were hardly any great physicists of the thcentury, of whom most educated people will have heard whether scientifically-inclined or not, who were not portrayed: Murphy as Oppenheimer, Kenneth Branagh as Niels Bohr (of Copenhagen interpretation fame), James D'Arcy as Oppenheimer’s Cambridge professor Patrick Blackett (whom Oppenheimer hated so much he left on his desk a deadly poisoned apple hoping to kill him, before later retrieving it in a panic), Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Matthias Schweighöfer as Werner Heisenberg, Jack Quaid as Feynman and, gloriously, really too many other important scientists and acclaimed actors to name here\", 'Have you not heard Vladimir Putin in recent months in the news threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine', 'Forget global warming for a second, before certainly remembering it again', 'The practically immediate destruction of the entire planet is possible, and humanity has had enough nuclear weapons to do so many times over long since ', 'By the early s there now exist an estimated , nuclear weapons in the world, which is a figure lower than at a peak of , at the height of the Cold War of the mid-s', 'Did you know that the first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on the Christian feast day of The Transfiguration of our Lord, held on  August annually worldwide', 'There must be something to say about that apparent perversion, one event described by eyewitnesses as a deadly light brighter than the sun, and the other when Jesus’s disciples say that they witnessed his transfiguration while praying on a mountain', 'Ethical questions have no end when people can so destroy themselves and others, needless to say', 'The film is far from warmongering, should anyone worry', 'Oppenheimer so repented of it that he spent the rest of his life campaigningagainstthe use of atomic weapons, and so much so that he was put on trial as a suspected Communist by his own fellow Americans', 'Post-Credit Scene– There is no post-credit scene', 'Warning– Contains a scene that may cause distress', 'Robert Oppenheimer, whose scope I doubt even three hours can completely cover', 'So to set the scene, the world is at war as Germany marches across Europe and Japan across the Pacific', 'This is already a dangerous predicament, but the world of theoretical physics has been running leaps and bounds forward, and everyone can see the endpoint, a bomb, a bomb of devastating potential', 'What happens if the Nazis get a bomb that can destroy cities', 'However, his past might contain more problems than the government can handle', 'Many people should getbiopicsmade of their lives, but I must admit that J', 'It could have been too much for a less experienced filmmaker to capture everything you needed, but Christopher Nolan and their team did not miss', 'There is not a weak link in the extensive cast', 'However, this does not stop with our two leads', 'Florence Pugh probably has the hardest performance in the movie, and I viscerally felt the pain of her character Jean Tatlock', 'This also includes perhaps the most awkward sex scene I have seen in a film in recent memory', 'It can be difficult to follow a film when it jumps back and forth between its internal timeline, but I was never lost', 'There were some moments where I wished they tweaked the sound mix or added subtitles, but thankfully this was not nearly as much a problem as it was in the past', 'One of the things that I was pleasantly surprised about was just how into the weeds it went with the issues around the political realities of the time, of the different ways to make a nuclear weapon with discussions about gun and implosion-type weapons', 'We even get deep into the weeds of Robert’s life, including when he tries to poison someone with a laced apple', 'We get discussions about the political reality of the strikes, scientists’ fears about them, and even Robert’s own internal dilemmas, but it is all reaction and not reality', 'We got Robert quoting the Bhagavad Gita \\xa0with “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds”', 'I just wish we also got Kenneth Bainbridge’s (Josh Peck) “Now we are all sons of bitches', 'They captured a time and a place, but more importantly, they delved into

creation of and entanglement of the myth of the man who history has come to call The Father of the Atom Bomb', 'Robert Oppenheimer, his role in the creation of the atom bomb, as well as his subsequent work on nuclear policy as well as the trial through which he finally lost his security clearance with the government of America (an incident which not only devastated him, but also his family; years later, his daughter would commit suicide over it', ') It also paints a picture of America at the beginning of the Atomic Age till the run up to the Cold War: the time of risingMcCarthyism', 'With a few exceptions, there is almost no frame in the movie which isn’t dominated by Murphy’s lanky frame and the exceptions almost all include politician Lewis Straus, as played by Robert Downey Jr', 'There is almost no frame in the movie which isn’t dominated by Murphy’s lanky frameAnd that is not down to Cillian Murphy himself necessarily, acting powerhouse though he may be', 'Scenes flash by, cut quickly so that one event leads to another but very few people linger long enough to make an impression outside of Oppenheimer himself', 'I had missed it in the quick pacing of the movie', 'For example: the women in Oppenheimer’s circuit exist around him to be both bolster him and tear him down alternatively, but he remains central to their lives despite everything; he offhandedly reveals that he has been cheating on his current wife with at least two different women at different points; while presenting a new house, his wife notices there is no kitchen, revealing his lack of knowledge (and interest) in knowing anything in the running of a home', 'All of these scenes exist for a reason, to show Oppenheimer as a flawed man but it falls a little flat against the movie’s overbearing tendency toalsobuild him up as a mythical figure', 'And this is disappointing because as much as Nolan seems willing to let the audience put together pieces elsewhere, he seems as afraid that they will miss some crucial element of Oppenheimer’s mental state and overcorrects by literally spelling it out', 'When Oppenheimer is presenting before a hostile committee which will eventually reject his security clearance, it is clear that he feels naked and exposed in front of them – and that is exactly what the camera shows him as, naked and exposed', 'The slow buildup to the bomb, itself a looming invisible presence the entire film, being hoisted up for the drop; it’s eventual detonation, the first completely silent flash followed by the roar of sound and the shock wave – it was a pivotal moment in the film and it stayed with the audience, as it did with me', 'There is a lack, a hole, in the filmOppenheimerand in the days before the release of the film, this resulted in a firestorm of discourse on social media', 'In a film made about the man who helped make one of the most infamous weapons in human history, where are its victims', 'Having watched the film (and also noted the conspicuous gap), I would argue that the film is aware of this lack and, for good or bad, it’s a deliberate choice', 'Walking away from the crowd, he steps through the pulverised burnt corpse of a child and looks down at it, uncomprehending', 'But this is not a movie about the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki', '(One can argue that others, including Japanese directors themselves, have made films reflecting on this traumatic event of history, such asBarefoot Gen, Hiroshima Mon Amour,or even Ishiro Honda’sGodzillawhere the titular monster is an allegory for the bomb and the devastation that followed', 'It is Oppenheimer that the camera focuses on when he is watching a film on the effects the atom bomb had on the victims in Japan', 'It is Oppenheimer whose moral revulsions are shown affecting his own stance on nuclear policy post World-War II', 'But the first half the film is spent in firmly building him up as a hero and the second half in trying to set him up as a flawed martyr', 'The end result is a man who exists as a semi-tragic figure in front of the camera and how much that sense of tragedy is earned remains a point of uncertainty for me', 'Leave a ReplyCancel replyYour email address will not be published', 'Join the generation that is working to make the world equal and violence free', 'Nolan’s three-hour R-rated historical drama is squarely focused on adult audiences, mostly men, and opens against pop culture sensationBarbieand returning box office championMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One', 'The runtime means less screenings per day, butOppenheimerhas exclusive access to IMAX for several weeks, and trends show we currently lack enough premium theaters to meet high audience demand', 'Barbielooks to top $+ million worldwide through Sunday, whileMission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part Oneis expected to finish somewhere near $+/- million in global receipts after its sophomore weekend', 'Older-skewing films have struggled lately, for the most part, especially tentpoles', '” and recall what they heard from friends/family and what they saw on Rotten Tomatoes', 'I suspect it will perform well in certain countries, far worse in others, and might not even screen in some markets', 'For now, it’s hard for me to say where I think the results will wind up, because my reaction toOppenheimeris different from most other critics, apparently', 'The marketing implies this is the story of the USA’s creation of the atomic bomb during World War II, and much mystery and buzz surrounds how Nolan depicts the eventual successful test of the atom bomb', 'Robert Oppenheimer and the bomb', 'Los Alamos is the backdrop against which the three main stories are told — his romantic life and affairs, the post-war attempts by his enemies to get his security clearance revoked, and an even later period of time when Lewis Strauss faced Congressional hearings to confirm him for a presidential cabinet position and his history of collaboration and conflict with Oppenheimer was a central focus', 'If so, though, then he attempted to adapt a biography by including so many threads that each held its own appeal and which fit together haphazardly and chaotically on the screen but which are still all part of the same lived life, and all of this chaos and all of those various threads are part of the larger story revolving around the central axis that is the introduction of nuclear weapons to our world', 'That this is both a remarkable scientific achievement and a potential guarantee that humanity is doomed, then, would speak profoundly to the issues that plagued Oppenheimer in this telling and represent humanity’s nature to make miraculous discoveries and then learn all of the wrong lessons from them', 'Sadly,Oppenheimerdoesn’t rise to the occasion in the latter regard, if that was the intent', 'And the biggest problem is that none of the rest of the story — especially the shallow presentation of his affairs, a related tragedy, and the much-reported sex scenes and nudity — are frankly remotely as interesting as the Los Alamos stuff', 'Every few scenes at Los Alamos, the story suddenly jumps to either the small room in which Oppenheimer is subjected to hours of questioning and character assassination, or a large Congressional chamber where we witness questions and answers during the confirmation process', 'If Oliver Stones’ filmJFKhad lacked a singular focused narrative point and perspective, if it focused mostly on exposition during meetings and instead of a sweeping narrative felt constrained and so grounded it seemed to be wearing lead shoes, if the more experimental moments were exaggerated even more, and if it was comprised of the most boring scenes and often the least relevant', 'It’s not even necessary the lack of particular position so much as the disinterested vacillating that’s really the problem', 'All of those complaints said, the performances are spectacular', 'But Oppenheimer underwhelms, from its overall inability to tell a coherent story to its lack of reason for us to invest in any of these people’s personal stories', 'The atomic test, which should be one of the highlights at least visually and emotionally, is mostly just the trailer shots except longer, and as soon as the sequence ended I was perplexed and wondered, “Was that it', '”Not that I just wanted a big CGI nuclear explosion — I understand what this film is meant to be and I know all of the arguments and points made about how and why war and destruction and armageddon shouldn’t be casually treated as entertainment, and why a would-be morality tale shouldn’t glamorize or glorify nuclear holocaust as an “achievement', '” But the moment, including actual restored and enhanced footage, could and should easily convey the dread and large-scale impression of absolute extinction — and the reactions of Oppenheimer and others witnessing it — can add to these themes (the film includes a few nods in this direction post-test, just not as much as I expected)', 'This is the central moment of Oppenheimer’s life, it’s why we speak his name today and why this movie exists and why his warning reverberate', 'Instead, I’m disappointed and would have a tough time sitting throughOppenheimeragain', \"Oppenheimer review – Nolan’s atom bomb epic is flawed but extraordinary | Oppenheimer | The

captures the most agonising of success storiesPeter BradshawWed  Jul  ', ' BSTShareThe wartime Soviet intelligence services had a codename for the Manhattan Project, the US’s plan to build an atom bomb:Enormoz', 'Christopher Nolan’s new film about it is absolutelyEnormoz, maybe his mostenormozso far: a gigantic, post-detonation study, a PTSD narrative procedure filling the giant screen with a million agonised fragments that are the shattered dreams and memories of the project’s haunted, complex driving force, J Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant physicist with the temperament of an artist who gave humanity the means of its own destruction', 'The main event is that terrifying first demonstration: the Trinity nuclear test in the New Mexico desert in July , whenOppenheimeris said to have silently pondered (and later intoned on TV) Vishnu’s lines from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds …”This is the big bang, and no one could have made it bigger or more overwhelming than Nolan', 'He does this without simply turning it into an action stunt – although this movie, for all its audacity and ambition, never quite solves the problem of its own obtuseness: filling the drama at such length with the torment of genius-functionary Oppenheimer at the expense of showing the Japanese experience and the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki', 'Nolan moves back and forth in time, either side of the historic  firebreak, giving us Oppenheimer’s beginnings as a young scientist, lonely and unhappy, electrified by the new developments in quantum mechanics, the young leftist who never became a Communist party member but whose anti-fascism galvanised his desire to develop the bomb before the Nazis could, directing the work of hundreds of scientists', 'Later in the s, there is the disillusioned, compromised administrator, hounded by the McCarthyites for his communist connections, nauseated by his own pointless celebrity, by his failure to establish postwar international atomic control and by a single denied thought: the Nazis surrendered long before there was any suggestion they had the weapon, and bombing the defeated Japanese at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was merely to cow the Russians with a ruthless demonstration of the US’s nuclear mastery', 'Matt Damon is the boorish Lt Gen Leslie Groves, Oppenheimer’s exasperated military minder; Kenneth Branagh is his genial scientific hero and mentor Niels Bohr; Robert Downey Jr is the duplicitous Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss; Florence Pugh plays his lover Jean Tatlock, whose heart he broke, while Emily Blunt is his wife, Kitty, also badly treated', 'Tom Conti plays the sorrowfully detached Albert Einstein, and it has to be said that Nolan, rightly or wrongly, uses non-Jewish actors for Oppenheimer and Einstein, two of the most famous Jewish people in history and in fact doesn’t quite get to grips with the antisemitism that Oppenheimer faced as an assimilated secular American Jew', 'View image in fullscreenAfter the first test, Oppenheimer is reported to have said ‘Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds’', 'Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal PicturesThere is a horribly gripping scene showing Oppenheimer’s formative experience as an unhappy graduate student in England at Christ’s College, Cambridge', 'He suffered what amounted to a psychotic breakdown and left a poisoned apple on the desk of his testy supervisor Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy), which Blackett fortunately didn’t notice and didn’t eat', 'Nolan coolly invites to see this as a parable for the lost Eden of a more innocent prewar physics, with Oppenheimer as a serpent with Adam’s foolish innocence', 'And of course there is the creeping biographical irony: how terribly close Oppenheimer came to … killing someone', 'after newsletter promotionCillian Murphy on Oppenheimer, sex scenes and self-doubt: ‘I’m stubborn and lacking in confidence – a terrible combination’Read moreThe purest payload of fear is delivered in a scene that Nolan handles with forthright gusto', 'Of course, Oppenheimer did not witness the actual use of his weapon, he never saw anything becoming death, the destroyer of worlds, and Nolan takes the decision to look away from it too, to stay in the US, to stay with Oppenheimer himself in all his sudden tragic irrelevance', 'Perhaps the film’s most important moment is the one that addresses its own flaw: the legendary postwar encounter in the White House Oval Office between Oppenheimer and President Harry S Truman (played by Gary Oldman), the man who took the final executive decision to drop the bomb', 'Angry and baffled, Truman tells him curtly that all this is his responsibility as president and asks a very pertinent question: does Oppenheimer think the Japanese care who made the bomb', 'No, they want to know who dropped it', 'In the end, Nolan shows us how the US’s governing class couldn’t forgive Oppenheimer for making them lords of the universe, couldn’t tolerate being in the debt of this liberal intellectual', 'Oppenheimer is poignantly lost in the kaleidoscopic mass of broken glimpses: the

inclusion of it seems to argue that it’s vital to the story', 'It loses itself in its own bleakness and becomes out of touch', 'Every moment is engineered for maximum realism, but instead of reflecting reality, it becomes a tedious exercise of how truly out of touch a film can become', 'And to me, my trepidation was extremely warranted', 'Nolan’s approach to thematic storytelling is based

at right around $ million', 'Already this year, Disney’sIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyhad a tough time appealing outside of its narrow target demos, andThe Flash— which counted in part on nostalgic appeal for Michael Keaton’s return as Batman — was a disaster for Warner Bros', 'Discovery', 'With a film this long and of this sort, everything relies heavily on word of mouth and reviews', 'I', 'ByMark HughesA grade of A- is the hardest to parse here, as it could swing either way and would largely depend on how international audiences react to the picture', 'Which would indeed have been a great story to tell, especially with hints that Nolan’s movie was a sort of “mad scientist” version of J', 'Too much screen time (relatively speaking) is dedicated to either Oppenheimer’s romantic and sexual relationships, in which women are portrayed as unreasonable, histrionic, mentally ill, and/or incapable of appreciating/accepting the demands and pressures he was under', 'Even the few women in the cast who aren’t Oppenheimer’s romantic interests or affairs — specifically, women on the team at Los Alamos — get little to say or are used to present positions and assertions framed as naive or overly simplistic compared against the turmoil and more complicated, serious considerations and burdens of “the great man', 'Perhaps Nolan’s attempt here is to create a cinematic representation of Oppenheimer’s life story that replicates quantum theory in certain regards — mixing up the timelines and jumping between them unequally and unpredictably (including because the editing is at times clipped and jarring), using varying and contrasting color and photographic techniques, switching between his more straightforward classic filmmaking approaches and almost experimental methods of photography and sound and editing (especially in the first act, and then later during a few climactic bomb-related sequences), and having storylines that converge and diverge sometimes in sync and other times at random', 'Is this Nolan’s expression of time existing at all moments simultaneously, so to speak', 'Is this how the chaos and confusion and mystery of quantum theory looks when distilled through artistry of filmmaking and representing someone who dedicated their life to quantum pursuits', '” because that’s what Oppenheimer has in store for you', 'The sex and nudity is both grossly overstated in the media, and yet also totally unnecessary to the point those scenes not only add nothing to the film or our understanding of Oppenheimer — or the relationships, or the subtexts, literally nothing is served by the nudity or sex scenes', 'And each storyline feels as if it were made by a different filmmaker with different ideas and intentions', 'And imagine if it has sex and nudity but as clinical, cold, and emotionless as possible, not to mention out of place and unnecessary to the point of distraction — the hero and his wife discussing the
